Question 3 Financial Statements continued 
 
 
 
 
Problem or deficiency 
State any accounting principle violated and 
how you suggest the problem be corrected 
1.  Title incorrect 
Should be Statement of Financial Position 
As at October 31, 2020 
2.  No indication of 
current and non- 
current assets and 
liabilities 
A classified statement should indicate those 
assets and liabilities which are current. Any other 
assets should be classified as long-term. 
3.  Property and 
equipment listed at fair 
market value 
This violates the historical cost principle. The 
assets should be recorded at the amount paid 
minus any accumulated depreciation. 
4.  Justin’s residence and 
related mortgage 
should not be included 
in the Statement of 
Financial Position 
This violates the entity principle – only assets 
and liabilities relating to Pearson Auto Limited 
ought to be included. 
5.  Accumulated 
Depreciation is not a 
liability 
Accumulated Depreciation is a contra account 
that offsets property and equipment. 
6.  Title “Claims and 
owner’s equity” is not 
appropriate. 
Should be Liabilities and Shareholder’s equity 
7.  Owner’s equity is not 
appropriate 
Amount should differentiate share capital from 
retained earnings.

3. Accounting Principles (7 marks, suggested time 10 minutes) 
 
a) Briefly explain both the accrual basis and the cash basis of accounting and 
indicate why most companies use the accrual basis. (4 marks) 
 
The accrual basis of accounting recognizes revenues in the period in which they are 
earned and expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Under this basis, the 
financial statements would be much more reflective of actual events because the 
revenues and related expenses would be shown in periods in which they were 
earned or incurred. It is meaningful because all of the profit generating activity 
incurred during a period is captured on the Statement of Income and readers have 
some idea of future cash inflows (accounts receivable) and outflows (accounts 
payable). 
 
The cash basis of accounting only recognizes revenues when the related cash is 
received. Expenses are only recognized when the related cash is paid out. With this 
basis, if a revenue or expense transaction is incurred in one period, but the relating 
revenue or expense transaction is not recognized until a later period, then each 
period's performance is distorted. 
 
b) “Financial statements of public companies audited by independent auditors 
provide with perfect information.”  Briefly discuss whether you agree with this 
statement. (3 marks) 
 
Audited Financial statements do provide users with some assurance that the 
information is fairly presented not that it is perfect.  Two important issues 
should be noted.  First financial statements use many estimates; secondly 
auditors do not look at every transaction nor can they be sure that 100% of all 
transactions have been recorded.

Supreme Equipment Sales Company had a balance in its accounts receivable account at 
December 31, 2005, of $120,000 and a $4,000 balance in its allowance for doubtful accounts. 
During 2006, the company sold equipment on credit in the amount of $820,000.  Total cash 
collections during 2006 were $780,000.  The company also determined that $6,000 of 
accounts would not be collectible, and wrote them off.  At the end of 2006, management 
determined that it should increase its allowance percentage to 1% of credit sales from the 
previous year’s 0.5%, because of an economic slowdown and the amount of accounts 
receivable that proved to be uncollectible during the year. 
Required: 
a. Prepare the necessary journal entries for recording all the 2006 transactions including
the adjustment for bad debts expense at year end.
b. Show the accounts receivable section of the balance sheet at December 31, 2006.

estimates that 1.5% of its sales on credit will prove to be uncollectible.  Of the total sales, 25% 
are cash sales and 75% are made on credit. 
Required: 
a. Prepare the necessary journal entry to record the bad debt expense for the year.
b. Show the accounts receivable section of the balance sheet at October 31.

Belkou Company began operations on January 1, 2005.  Its first year’s sales were $1,100,000, 
which were 70% on credit.  On December 31, 2005, the accounts receivable had a debit 
balance of $75,000.  Management estimated that 0.5% of all credit sales would probably be 
uncollectible.  The company wrote off accounts worth $2,800 at year end. 
At the end of 2006, the balances in selected accounts were: accounts receivable, $86,000; 
allowance for doubtful accounts, $4,200 (debit balance); sales, $1,540,000 (70% on credit).  
The bad debt expense for 2006 had not been determined or recorded. 
After reviewing the write-off of accounts receivable during 2006, the company decided that the 
estimate of uncollectibility should be increased from 0.5% to 0.75%. 
Required: 
a. Provide the journal entry to record the bad debt expense for 2006.
b. Prepare a T account for the allowance for doubtful accounts, and enter into the account
all of the transactions that have affected it since the company started operations.
c. What is the net amount of accounts receivable at the end of 2006?

Question 
Analysis 
Step 1: Is there a 
contract? 
Yes, both parties have agreed to enter into a 
contract.  The quantity, price, and payment 
terms have been agreed to and each party’s 
rights under the contract are clear. The 
contract is consistent with both parties’ lines 
of business, meaning it has commercial 
substance.  There are no indications of any 
concerns 
regarding 
collectibility 
as 
subscriptions are paid in advance and single 
Boxes are also sold in cash transactions. 
Step 2: What 
performance 
obligations are included 
in the contract? 
There is a single distinct good (a snack box) 
being provided under the contract: 10,000 
monthly subscriptions 10,000 x 12 months = 
120,000 boxes and 2,400 monthly boxes 
2,400 x 12 = 28,800 boxes to specialty shops.  
Step 3: What is the 
transaction price? 
The transaction prices are: 
Good Box: $12.00 ($144/12 months) 
Oh So Good Box: $20.00 ($240/12 months) 
Specialty shop boxes: $8 each 
Step 4: How should the 
transaction price be 
allocated to the 
performance 
obligations? 
There is no need to allocate the transaction 
price because there is a single performance 
obligation. 
Step 5: Has a 
performance obligation 
been satisfied? 
Revenue would be recognized once the 
boxes are delivered to the subscription 
customers and the specialty shops, net of any 
refund liability.

Question 
Analysis 
Step 1: Is there a contract? Yes, both parties have agreed to enter into 
a contract.  The quantity, price, and 
payment terms have been agreed to and 
each party’s rights under the contract are 
clear. The contract is consistent with both 
parties’ lines of business, meaning it has 
commercial substance.  There are no 
indications of any concerns regarding 
collectibility from the government agency. 
Step 2: What performance 
obligations are included in 
the contract? 
There is a single distinct good being 
provided under contract: 100 systems. 
Step 3: What is the 
transaction price? 
The transaction price is $5,000,000 (100 x 
$50,000) 
Step 4: How should the 
transaction price be 
allocated to the 
performance obligations? 
There is no need to allocate the transaction 
price because there is a single performance 
obligation. 
Step 5: Has a performance 
obligation been satisfied? 
Revenue would be recognized once the 
systems are delivered to the customer.

Webber had a much better gross margin percentage in 2024. 
 
c.  No, 2024, the year with the higher gross margin percentage did not have 
the highest net income.  This is due to the fact that operating expenses 
were higher (as a percentage of sales). While having a higher gross 
margin increases the likelihood of a higher net income, a company also 
needs to control its operating expenses to ensure it is the case.

Although the cash has been received and economic benefits have 
been received by the retailer, the performance obligation has not been 
met; they need to provide the goods to the customer before the revenue 
can be recognized.  The amount of revenue will only be measurable at 
the time the gift cards are redeemed as the customer may purchase 
products that sell for less than, the same amount or more than the value 
of the gift card.  The retailer also has no idea of what its product costs 
will be at the time the gift cards are sold.  No revenue can be recognized 
until the retailer fulfills its obligation to holders of the gift cards by 
providing them with goods when the cards are redeemed.  Thus, the 
gift cards should be recognized in the financial statements as a liability 
(i.e. deferred revenue). 
 
 
When the gift cards are redeemed at point of sale, the payment or a 
portion of the payment is made using the gift card. The sale will be 
completed through the delivery of merchandise and consequently the 
performance obligation will be met and the revenue recorded.  The sale 
will be recorded with a reduction in deferred revenue for the 
appropriate portion using gift cards.

a. Preparing statements of income by function requires management to 
exercise judgement in terms of which expenses are allocated to each 
function.  For example, wages must be allocated to the various 
functions.  The students may be concerned about the reliability of the 
allocations of expenses between functions.  The university would likely 
want to maximize the amounts allocated to instruction/student support 
and minimize the allocations to ancillary items.  Students may also be 
concerned that the specific functions chosen by the university are too 
broad (i.e. there are only two) and may not provide useful information 
for comparing expenses from period by period for specific areas of the 
university or to other universities.  For example, combining instruction 
with student support services does not enable users to see how much 
each of those different areas has changed from one period to the next.  
The university also has no category for administration, so it is unclear 
where the costs of the university’s executives would be allocated. 
 
It should be noted that if the university decides to prepare their 
statement of income by function, they will still need to present 
information on the nature of expenses in the notes to the financial 
statements.  While this helps, it does not allow users to understand 
where these expenses have been allocated. 
 
The students’ union might want to recommend that the university adopt 
a few more functions.  They may suggest splitting instruction and 
student support into two functions.  They may also want to see the 
library, cafeteria, residence or the bookstore as separate functions.  
Normally, administration costs (i.e. the university’s executive and 
governance costs) are also of interest to students, so they could 
suggest that these be a separate function.  The students’ union would 
also want to look at the categories used by other universities to ensure 
that the ones being proposed at their institution are comparable.  This 
would allow the students’ union to compare changes from one period 
to the next and to the changes occurring at other universities.

a. Gildan reduces its gross sales to net sales by deducting customer price 
discounts, sales discounts for prompt payments, volume rebates, 
estimated sales returns sales allowances for damaged goods. These 
types of reductions from sales are also tracked separately in the accounts 
for management decision making purposes. 
 
b. 2020 Gross Profit Margin:  $249,059 / $1,981,276 = 12.6% 
    2019 Gross Profit Margin:  $704,461 / $2,823,901 = 24.9% 
 
Gildan’s gross profit margin dramatically deteriorated 12.3% in 2020.  
This change is likely due to Covid 19.  It means that the company has 
been unable to increase its selling prices or reduce its product costs, or 
both so the company would have more of each dollar of sales to cover its 
non-product costs. 
 
c. 2021 Gross Profit Margin:  $1,765,011 / $4,026,259 = 43.8% 
 
  2020 Gross Profit Margin:  $1,652,358 / $3,787,291 = 43.6% 
 
Dollarama’s gross profit margin increased slightly from the 2020 to the 
2021 fiscal year. Its gross profit margin exceeds that of Gildan. 
 
d. Gildan uses a multi-step approach in preparing its consolidated 
statements of earnings and comprehensive income.  
 
e. Gildan presents its expenses by function, which takes more professional 
judgment that presenting by nature.  With functional presentation, all 
operating expenses must be allocated by some fair estimates, among the 
various functions of the company.

c.  Because the outstanding deposit had not been recorded by the bank, 
and exceeded the amount of outstanding cheques, the balance 
reported on the bank statement was lower than the adjusted balance.     
 
Similarly, because the collection of the account receivable by the 
bank had not been recorded by the company, the balance reported 
in the accounting records was too low and the adjusted balance was 
higher.

credit losses, an adjustment is made for any existing balance in the 
allowance for expected credit losses. 
 
b.  $60,000 This is the value of the accounts that were written off  
during the year.  
 
c. Accrual accounting requires companies to recognize expenses in 
the period in which they are incurred.  Credit losses are a function 
of selling on account and is incurred in the period in which the 
credit sales take place. The allowance method does this by 
recognizing the credit losses in the period in which the sale occurs 
and providing an allowance for future writeoffs. Thus, it provides a 
better measure of periodic income than the direct writeoff method.  
 
Also, under the allowance method, the accounts receivable are 
presented on the statement of financial position at a realistic 
amount (their net carrying amount), representing the amount that 
is actually expected to be collectible. By contrast, the direct writeoff 
method simply reports the receivables at their gross amount, and 
therefore overstates their value.

b. The company has exceeded its target of 2.2 for the current ratio, but 
did not meet its target of 0.9 for the quick ratio. In fact, the quick ratio 
is worse this year than last, having dropped from 0.8 last year to 0.7 
for the current year. 
 
c. The company could improve its current position by reducing its 
substantial investment in inventory (i.e. reducing inventory levels, 
carrying a smaller range of products, etc.).  Reducing the inventory 
level would free up some cash and thus enable the company to reduce 
its short-term liabilities, which would improve its current ratio 
somewhat and dramatically improve its quick ratio. The risk 
associated with reducing the amount of inventory that the company 
carries is that there may be a negative effect on sales due to stock 
outs.

c. The FIFO cost formula results in a greater gross margin for March. 
This is because the total sales revenue is the same under either 
method, but the COGS is smaller under FIFO because the older, 
lower costs were assigned to cost of goods sold, resulting in a larger 
gross margin for the month.

d. Ending inventory, weighted-average cost: 
 
       4,700 units X $7.6667/unit  
  = $36,033 or 
 
       $92,500 – $56,467 
 
  = $36,033 
 
 
    Ending inventory, FIFO cost: 
 
       4,700 units X $8.00/unit  
  = $37,600 or 
 
       $92,500 – $54,900  
 
  = $37,600 
 
 
Therefore, the FIFO cost formula results in a larger inventory 
balance at the end of March. 
 
e. Because the cost of goods available for sale ($92,500) is the same 
regardless of the cost formula used, the cost formula with the higher 
ending inventory should also result in the lower cost of goods sold 
amount, the larger gross margin and the larger net income. This is the 
case when the FIFO inventory cost formula is used above. 
 
Alternatively, the cost formula that allocates the lower cost to ending 
inventory will have the larger cost of goods sold amount on the 
statement of income. This, in turn, results in a smaller gross margin 
and smaller net income. This is the case when the weighted-average 
cost formula is used above.

c. The FIFO method results in the higher gross margin. This can be 
explained by the fact that inventory costs were increasing (from $25 to 
$35) and under FIFO, these higher costs are assigned to ending 
inventory rather than COGS. As a result, COGS is lower under FIFO 
and gross margin in higher.

a. The decline in net realizable value is relevant because when users 
see inventory listed on the statement of financial position they assume 
that it can be sold for at least as much as its carrying amount.  This is 
not the case for CPC’s newsprint inventory, whose net realizable 
value is now less than its cost.  Consequently, the inventory should 
be reported at its lower net realizable value, rather than its cost. 
 
b. Inventory must be reported at the lower of cost and net realizable 
value on the statement of financial position and the current NRV is 
$505 per tonne which is less than the average cost of $520 per tonne.  
As a result, the inventory should be valued at $631,250 ($505 x 1,250 
tonnes).  This assumes that the selling prices in the markets in which 
CPC sells its newsprint reflect the same prices as the international 
market. If CPC also has to incur additional selling costs associated 
with selling its newsprint, the unit net realizable value would have to 
be further reduced by the per tonne selling costs. 
 
c. CPC would also have to determine whether it has firm contracts with 
its customers that provide for a full recovery of CPC’s inventory and 
selling costs in which case no reduction in carrying amount would be 
required at the end of 2024.   
 
d. In deciding the dollar amount of inventory to report, several accounting 
concepts are important. The accounting principle of historic cost is 
key, which states that assets should normally be valued at their 
acquisition or production cost. However, the qualitative characteristic 
of relevance comes into play in this case where historic cost may not 
be the most relevant measure for the inventory. Net realizable value 
would be more useful for investor decision-making. The requirement 
for accounting measurements to represent faithfully what is being 
reported would also argue for NRV, which comes closer to the actual 
value of the inventory asset to the company.

CAE Inc. experienced a decline in its inventory turnover ratio in its 
year ended March 31, 2020. In 2019, the company sold out its 
inventory every 365/4.4 = 83 days, while in 2020, it took 365/4.1 = 89 
days – 7% longer. This negative change would be of interest to 
management and to investors. It is of note that the work-in-progress 
inventory was significantly higher in 2020, possibility due to the stage 
of progress on specific equipment being manufactured. 
 
The gross margin ratio increased, from 28.5% to 29.9%. While this 
may seem to be a small percentage, 1.4%, in this case, translates into 
an increase in gross margin of $50.7 million (1.4% x $3,623.2) that 
can be used to cover remaining expenses and to increase income 
before tax. Even small percentage changes should be analyzed by 
management.

The fact that the reported revenue includes revenue from the delivery 
of services as well as from the manufacture and sale of products could 
significantly influence the gross margin ratio. This is because there is 
no cost of goods sold for service revenues which means that the 
reported gross margin is higher than was actually realized from the 
sale of products. Therefore, the service revenue amount should be 
deducted from the revenue amount (the denominator) as well as the 
gross margin amount (the numerator). 
 
 
For example, if the revenue numbers reported contained $300 of 
service revenue in 2019 and only $100 in 2020, what would happen 
to the gross margin ratios calculated above? 
 
 
Revised gross margin ratio calculations: 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2020  
 
2019 
 
Revised gross margin amount 
$1,084.0 - $100    $941.5 - $300 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  = $984.0  
     = $641.5 
 
 
Revised revenue amount 
 
$3,623.2 - $100    $3,304.1

$300 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  = $3,523.2 
    = $3,004.1 
 
Revised gross margin % 
 
        27.9%  
 
21.4% 
 
As the revised numbers illustrate, a very different picture emerges. By 
combining the sales and service revenues on the face of the 
statement of income, it is impossible to determine whether 
management has performed well in this area or not. However, from 
the company’s perspective, management would prefer to keep the 
figures combined so that its competitors and customers cannot 
determine its mark-up policies.

Because CAE designs, manufactures and sells unique products for 
specific customers, the specific identification cost formula is 
appropriate for its work in process and any finished goods inventory. 
Each product has unique costs and a unique selling price, so for cost 
control and the evaluation of management performance, specific 
identification would be the most appropriate method to use. 
 
It is appropriate to use a method other than specific identification for 
CAE’s raw material inventories because the raw materials are likely 
generic items such as wire, paint, welding supplies, aluminum, nickel, 
or steel that could go into any number of the contracted pieces of 
equipment the company produces.  There would be many such items 
and it would be difficult and costly to maintain a specific identification 
cost formula system for them. In addition, these items that go into 
production are very likely not specifically identifiable in any case.

Practice Questions & Solutions on Adjusting Journal Entries/Income Statements  
 
Problem 1 Adjusting Journal Entries  
 
On December 31, 2013, the bookkeeper of Atomic Company prepared a statement of income 
and a balance sheet. The statement of income showed net income of $60,000 while the balance 
sheet reflected total assets of $320,000, total liabilities of $80,000, and shareholders’ equity of 
$240,000. The controller of the company realized that the statements were incorrect as the 
bookkeeper had not prepared adjusting journal entries relating to the following information: 
 
1.  Wages amounting to $47,000 for the last 4 days of December 2013 had not been paid 
nor recorded. 
2. An amount of $9,200 was received from a customer on December 1, 2013 for the lease 
of equipment for the period December 1, 2013 to January 15, 2014. The full amount 
was credited to Unearned Revenue.  
3. Amortization for the year on equipment that cost $150,000 was not recorded. The 
equipment was purchased on November 30, 2012, had an estimated useful life of 8 
years and a residual value of $30,000. 
4. On September 30, 2013, Atomic paid $18,000 for a three-year insurance policy. The

C2-2  Daisy-Fresh Dry Cleaning 
 
1. The payment of the insurance policy should have been recorded as a 
prepaid expense when it was purchased. A prepaid expense is a current 
asset because there is a future benefit associated with the policy. As the 
year progresses, the benefits of the policy are used up because the 
company has been provided with insurance coverage for that time period. 
As the benefits of the policy expire, the related costs should be expensed. 
At the end of the first year, one-third of the three-year policy would have 
expired; therefore, one-third of the policy costs should be expensed. The 
remaining two-thirds should remain as a prepaid expense on the asset 
side of the statement of financial position.  
 
2. The full amount of the cost of the new dry-cleaning machine ($10,000) 
should have been recorded as an asset when it was purchased. As time 
passes and the machine is used, it should be depreciated as an expense 
on the statement of income which would reduce the carrying value of the 
machine on the statement of financial position. The machine's 
depreciation expense should be reported in the same period in which it is 
used to help generate revenue.  Using straight-line depreciation would 
result in an expense of $800 for the current year ([$10,000 - $2,000] / 5 * 
6/12 = $800) 
 
3. The company should report all future claims on its assets even when those 
claims don’t become due for four years.  The loan should be recorded as 
a long-term liability until the end of the third year, at which point it becomes 
a current liability, payable within the normal operating year of the 
company.  Recording the loan on the books now provides a complete 
listing of total liabilities owed by the organization. 
  
4. The interest on the loan to the bank should be recorded in the period in 
which it is incurred. Even though the owner did not yet pay any of the 
interest, there is an obligation to pay the interest in the near future, thus 
there is a claim on the assets of the company that should be recorded in 
the financial statements. The company should report an interest expense 
on the statement of income and an interest payable on the statement of 
financial position, as a current liability. 

C2-2 (Continued) 
 
5. Dividends represent a distribution of profits to the shareholders.  Dividends 
are not recorded as an expense but rather directly reduce the retained 
earnings of the business. Because dividends are a distribution of profit and 
not an expense, their payment should not be reported on the statement of 
income. The payment of dividends appears on the statement of retained 
earnings (ASPE) or the statement of changes in equity (IFRS), and as a 
financing activity on the statement of cash flows.

C2-3 Mega Manufacturing 
 
Mega Manufacturing appears to be improving its financial position to be more 
In line with the performance of other companies in the same industry. 
  
Profit margin has decreased in the past year, which indicates that the level of 
profit generated by each dollar of sales revenue declined.  The company remains 
well above the industry average. 
 
Currently the company is able to generate a return of 10% on its assets.  This 
means that for every $100 invested in assets the company is able to generate 
profits of $10. The company appears to be performing slightly below the average 
for companies in the industry, but has improved these results in the last year. 
 
Finally, the return on equity ratio compares the profits earned in the business 
to the amount invested by shareholders.  Shareholders will use this ratio to 
evaluate the ability of the business to provide them with an acceptable return 
on their investment. Investors will often compare the return on equity for 
businesses of similar risk to make decisions about buying new shares or selling 
their existing shares.  With a return on shareholders’ equity of 12%, Mega 
Manufacturing is providing investors with a return that is below the industry 
average.  The 2% increase over the past year should make this company an 
attractive investment, especially if it continues to increase and it becomes 
closer to the industry average.

of $7,550 represents a 17.4% return on the assets invested which far 
exceeds what might be available from more passive investments. Also, 
total assets of $43,300 and only $10,750 of liabilities demonstrate the 
financial health of the business in that the shareholders have financed 
about 75% of the assets of the business. This indicates a relatively low 
risk factor.

Annual Report  |  2020

• Omni guest experience. Our digital comps more than doubled for the full year, 
enabling us to achieve our goal of doubling our e-commerce business from 2018 
levels three years early. We pulled forward investments in our digital ecosystem and 
quickly rolled out new capabilities, including a digital educator service and online 
sweatlife tools. We introduced virtual waitlists, appointment shopping, and buy 
online pickup at door and curbside to elevate the guest experience in our stores, 
and continued to expand with 30 net new stores. And MIRROR joined the lululemon 
family, increasing our total addressable market through its strong community focus. 
• International expansion. International revenue grew 31% in 2020, a clear 
demonstration of our brand’s ability to translate across geographies and cultures. 
At 14% penetration, we are in the early days of our international growth opportunity—
and remain on track to quadruple the business from 2018 levels by 2023. Looking 
into the not-too-distant future, I can see a time when our international revenues are 
on par with what we deliver in North America.
The Power of Impact 
We also saw how the stress and unknowns of COVID-19 took a toll on the wellbeing of 
our communities, drawing attention to the need to be physically, mentally, and socially 
well. We conducted our first Global Wellbeing Report and surveyed people around the 
world, finding that only 29% of all respondents have a strong state of wellbeing, with 
younger generations experiencing the lowest wellbeing of all groups. I am determined 
for lululemon to help advocate for and support people in their pursuit of wellbeing, 
with our unique experience in the Science of Feel, mindfulness, exercise and building 
communities each playing a role.
We also released our first Impact Agenda to detail our strategies and plans related to 
product sustainability and equity for our people. Our dozen goals for the future include 
making 100% of our products with sustainable materials and end of use solutions by 
2030, using 100% renewable electricity to power our operations by 2021, and achieving  
a 60% intensity reduction in carbon emissions across our global supply chain by  
2030 as well.
Importantly, we also accelerated programs to become a more inclusive and diverse 
company. Our approach is called IDEA – Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Action – and 
it started with us focusing on the systemic changes we need to make within lululemon 
to truly reflect the diversity of the communities in which we serve. Our actions thus 
far include expanding our IDEA team globally, establishing voluntary employee-led 
resource groups, and leveraging our brand and our voice to stand against hate and 
discrimination around the world.
Within each of these components of the Power of Impact, we recognize and take 
seriously the near-term and long-term responsibilities we have to create and sustain 
positive change, and we know the strength of our company performance allows  
us to do so.
Our Future
In closing, I would like to express my deep gratitude to our global teams, our guests  
and Ambassadors, our Board of Directors, and, to all of you, our shareholders. 
I couldn’t be more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We are in the early 
innings of our growth, as we continue to expand across geographies, categories, and 
channels. Our success over multiple years enables us to ask ourselves “how high is 
high” in terms of the future we will create. It will be exciting to see what our incredible 
team of leaders and people can accomplish.
Thank you for your support and the confidence you have in all of us at lululemon.    
We will continue to work tirelessly to innovate together and inspire one another to 
continue delivering for the many groups who form our expanding lululemon family.
Sincerely,
 
Calvin McDonald
Chief Executive Officer
2020 was a year unlike any other—and it presented both challenges and 
opportunities as world events shifted around us.
I am incredibly proud of how lululemon navigated the year. Our success was 
grounded in putting our collective first by providing pay protection for our 
employees, supporting our Ambassadors, creating a hardship fund to support 
our people, and honouring commitments to our landlords and vendors. 
How we protected our teams reflects the unique culture and values of lululemon, 
which separates us in our industry. Cutting costs may be easy in the short term, 
but investing in our teams, Ambassadors, and business partners demonstrates 
that our values truly matter.
This guiding principle enabled us to remain agile and innovate over the course 
of the year. And I believe we will look back and view 2020 as a pivotal moment 
for lululemon, as we accelerated innovations and initiatives that will create 
additional opportunities for us into the future.
This letter is an exciting opportunity to share a few highlights of the past year,  
as we delivered on our Power of Three growth strategy, completed the 
acquisition of MIRROR, and further strengthened our financial position.
More than any single accomplishment, I am proud of how the results 
demonstrate the strength of our product assortment and the connection  
to our guests, which enabled us to win and to gain market share, both  
before and during the pandemic.  
Looking ahead, we know lululemon is uniquely positioned and differentiated 
in the market, given people want to live a healthy and active lifestyle, demand 
technical products that perform above the competition, and are attracted  
to a brand that authentically connects with guests, our collective, and 
our communities.  
These consumer behaviours will fuel our momentum well into the future, 
and, in fact, lululemon is just getting started with our growth potential across 
channels, regions, genders, and activities. 
In 2020, we remained focused on delivering on our Power of Three growth 
strategy to double our men’s business, double our digital business, and 
quadruple our international business by year end 2023. At the same time,  
we recognized this was an important moment for lululemon to use our voice  
and brand to create positive change for our people and planet, which we 
reference internally as the Power of Impact. 
Consistent Performance
The numbers in our Annual Report show the level of success we achieved. Total 
revenue grew by 11% to $4.4 billion—with 23% revenue growth in the second half  
of the year. We also more than doubled our e-commerce business, and we ended  
the year with $1.2 billion in cash and no debt. 
This is all the more impressive given there was no playbook to a year like 2020. 
When the realities of COVID-19 became clear, our global leadership team quicky 
established three guiding principles: support our people, make balanced decisions,  
and continue to invest in the future. 
We invested in areas of the business where immediate opportunities existed, such as 
our digital and technology platforms, and leaning into innovative programs such as 
having our store Educators connect virtually and shop with our guests. And we looked 
into the future and welcomed MIRROR to the lululemon family, jumpstarting our move 
into at-home fitness and extending our eco-system of how we serve guests.
These guiding principles paid off, and we gained market share driven by both our 
men’s and women’s business, as indicated by our nearly one-point US retailer market 
share gain in fiscal year.*
The Power of Three 
Despite all the potential distractions in 2020, I am proud of how our teams across 
lululemon remained continually focused on our long-term growth drivers. Established 
in 2019, the Power of Three guides our discussions and fuels our aspirations, and we 
made considerable progress this year: 
• Product innovation. Guided by our Science of Feel innovation platform,  
we continued to raise the bar in our core Yoga, Run, Train, and On the Move 
categories, from relaunching our proprietary Everlux fabric in new styles,  
to expanding our Align franchise into tops, to offering some of our best  
performing styles in a more inclusive size range for women.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
lululemon athletica inc. is principally a designer, distributor, and retailer of healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel and 
accessories. We have a vision to be the experiential brand that ignites a community of people through sweat, grow, and 
connect, which we call "living the sweatlife." Since our inception, we have fostered a distinctive corporate culture; we 
promote a set of core values in our business which include taking personal responsibility, nurturing entrepreneurial spirit, 
acting with honesty and courage, valuing connection and inclusion, and choosing to have fun. These core values attract 
passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals, and share our purpose "to 
elevate the world by unleashing the full potential within every one of us."
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, lululemon athletica inc. (together with its 
subsidiaries) is referred to as "lululemon," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our." We refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 
2021 as "2020" and the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020 as "2019."

Our Products
Our healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel and accessories are marketed under the lululemon brand. We offer a 
comprehensive line of apparel and accessories. Our apparel assortment includes items such as pants, shorts, tops, and jackets 
designed for a healthy lifestyle including athletic activities such as yoga, running, training, and most other sweaty pursuits. We 
1

also offer a range of products designed for being On the Move and fitness-related accessories. We expect to continue to 
broaden our merchandise offerings through expansion across these product areas.
Our design and development team continues to source technically advanced fabrics, with new feel and fit, and craft 
innovative functional features for our products. Through our vertical retail strategy and direct connection with our customers, 
who we refer to as guests, we are able to collect feedback and incorporate unique performance and fashion needs into our 
design process. In this way, we believe we are better positioned to address the needs of our guests, helping us advance our 
product lines and differentiate us from the competition.
During the second quarter of 2020, we acquired Curiouser Products Inc., dba MIRROR. MIRROR is an in-home fitness 
company with an interactive workout platform that features live and on-demand classes. The acquisition of MIRROR bolsters 
our digital sweatlife offerings and brings immersive and personalized in-home sweat and mindfulness content to new and 
existing lululemon guests.
Our Market
Our guests seek a combination of performance, style, and sensation in their athletic apparel, choosing products that 
allow them to feel great however they exercise. Since consumer purchase decisions are driven by both an actual need for 
functional products and a desire to live a particular lifestyle, we believe the credibility of our brand and the authentic 
community experiences we offer expand our potential market beyond just athletes to those who pursue an active, mindful, 
and balanced life.
Although our largest customer group is made up of guests who shop our women's range, representing 69% of our 2020 
net revenue, we also design a comprehensive men's line and have a targeted strategy in place. Our business is growing as 
more guests discover the technical rigor and premium quality of our men's products, and are attracted by our distinctive 
brand.
North America is our largest market by geographical split, representing 86% of our 2020 net revenue. We are expanding 
internationally across Europe, the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), and the rest of Asia Pacific. We are expanding in these 
regions via a decentralized model, allowing for local community insight and consumer preference to inform our strategic 
expansion.
Our Segments
We primarily conduct our business through two channels: company-operated stores and direct to consumer. 
We also conduct business through MIRROR, operate outlets and temporary locations, serve certain wholesale accounts, 
have license and supply arrangements, and hold warehouse sales from time to time. The financial results of these operations 
are disclosed in Other.

Company-Operated Stores
At the end of 2020, we operated 521 stores in 17 countries across the globe. In addition to being a venue to sell our 
products, our stores give us a direct connection to our guest, which we view as a valuable tool in helping us build our brand 
and product line. Our retail stores are located primarily on street locations, in lifestyle centers, and in malls.

__________
(1) PRC included seven stores in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, two stores in Macao, Special Administration Region, and two stores in Taiwan, as 
of January 31, 2021. As of February 2, 2020, there were six stores in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, two stores in Macao, Special Administration 
Region, and one store in Taiwan.
We opened 30 net new company-operated stores in 2020, including 21 net new stores outside of North America.
We perform ongoing evaluations of our portfolio of company-operated store locations. During 2020, we closed 10 of 
our lululemon branded company-operated stores. As we continue our evaluations we may, in the future, close or relocate 
additional company-operated stores.
In fiscal 2021, our new store growth will come primarily from company-operated store openings in Asia and in the 
United States. Our real estate strategy over the next several years will not only consist of opening new company-operated 
stores, but also in overall square footage growth through store expansions and relocations.
We believe that our innovative retail concept and guest experience contribute to the success of our stores. We typically 
use sales per square foot to assess the performance of our company-operated stores. As a significant number of our stores 
were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 during the first two quarters of 2020, we do not believe sales per square foot is 
currently useful to investors in understanding performance, therefore we have not included this metric. 
Direct to Consumer
We believe that e-commerce is convenient for our core guest and enhances the image of our brand. Our direct to 
consumer channel also allows us to reach and serve guests in markets beyond where our physical retail locations are based. 
We believe this channel is effective in building brand awareness, especially in new markets.
3

We serve our guests via our e-commerce website www.lululemon.com, other country and region specific websites, and 
mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers or other 
retail locations.
We continue to evolve and integrate our digital and physical channels in order to enrich our interactions with our 
guests, and to provide an enhanced omni-channel experience.
Other
Our other operations include:
•
MIRROR - we offer in-home fitness through an interactive workout platform that allows our guests to subscribe for 
live and on-demand classes
•
Outlets and warehouse sales - We utilize outlets as well as physical warehouse sales, which are held from time to 
time, to sell slow moving inventory and inventory from prior seasons at discounted prices. As of January 31, 2020, 
we operated 38 outlets, with the majority in North America.
•
Temporary locations - Our temporary locations, including seasonal stores, are typically opened for a short period of 
time. We believe these retail locations enable us to serve guests during peak shopping periods in markets where we 
do not ordinarily have a physical location, or enable us to better serve our guest in markets where we see high 
demand at our existing locations.
•
Wholesale - Our wholesale accounts include premium yoga studios, health clubs, and fitness centers. We believe 
these premium wholesale locations offer an alternative distribution channel that is convenient for our core guest 
and enhances the image of our brand. We do not intend wholesale to be a significant contributor to overall sales. 
Instead, we use the channel to build brand awareness, including outside of North America.
•
License and supply arrangements - We enter into license and supply arrangements from time to time when we 
believe that it will be to our advantage to partner with companies and individuals with significant experience and 
proven success in certain target markets.
We have license and supply arrangements with partners in the Middle East and Mexico which grant them the right to 
operate lululemon branded retail locations in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and Mexico. We retain 
the rights to sell lululemon products through our e-commerce websites in these countries. Under these arrangements we 
supply the partners with lululemon products, training and other support. An extension to the initial term of the agreement for 
the Middle East was signed in 2020 and it extends the arrangement to December 2024. The initial term of the agreement for 
Mexico expires in November 2026. As of January 31, 2021, there were four licensed retail locations in Mexico, three in the 
United Arab Emirates, and one in Qatar, which are not included in the above company-operated stores table.
Community-Based Marketing
We utilize a community-based approach to build brand awareness and guest loyalty. We pursue a multi-faceted 
strategy which leverages our local teams and ambassadors, digital marketing and social media, in-store community boards, 
and a variety of grassroots initiatives. We also plan to complement and amplify our community-based initiatives with global 
brand-building activity.
Product Design and Development
Our product design and development efforts are led by a team of researchers, scientists, engineers, and designers. Our 
team is comprised of athletes and users of our products who embody our design philosophy and dedication to premium 
quality. Our design and development team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the 
input of our guests and our ambassadors, and broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of function, style, and 
technical superiority.
As we strive to continue to provide our guests with technically advanced fabrics, our team works closely with our 
suppliers to incorporate the latest in technical innovation, bringing particular specifications to our products. We partner with 
independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety of tests on our fabrics, testing 
performance characteristics including pilling, shrinkage, abrasion resistance, and colorfastness. We develop proprietary 
fabrics and collaborate with leading fabric and trims suppliers to manufacture fabrics and trims that we ultimately protect 
through agreements, trademarks, and trade-secrets.
4

Sourcing and Manufacturing
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide fabrics for, 
and to produce, our products. The following statistics are based on cost.
We work with a group of approximately 40 vendors that manufacture our products, five of which produced 59% of our 
products in 2020, with the largest manufacturer producing 17%. During 2020, 33% of our products were manufactured in 
Vietnam, 20% in Cambodia, 12% in Sri Lanka, and 9% in the PRC, including 2% in Taiwan.
We work with a group of approximately 65 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. In 2020, 65% of our fabrics 
were produced by our top five fabric suppliers, with the largest manufacturer producing 29%. During 2020, 45% of our fabrics 
originated from Taiwan, 18% from Mainland China, 16% from Sri Lanka, and the remainder from other regions. 
We also source other raw materials which are used in our products, including items such as content labels, elastics, 
buttons, clasps, and drawcords from suppliers located predominantly in the Asia Pacific region.
We have developed long-standing relationships with a number of our vendors and take great care to ensure that they 
share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not, however, have any long-term term contracts with the majority of our 
suppliers or manufacturing sources for the production and supply of our fabrics and garments, and we compete with other 
companies for fabrics, raw materials, and production. We require that all of our manufacturers adhere to our vendor code of 
ethics regarding social and environmental sustainability practices. Our product quality and sustainability teams partner with 
leading inspection and verification firms to closely monitor each supplier's compliance with applicable laws and our vendor 
code of ethics.
Distribution Facilities
We operate and distribute finished products from our distribution facilities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. 
We own our distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, and lease our other distribution facilities. We also utilize third-party 
logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from their warehouse locations in the United Sates, the PRC, 
and the Netherlands. We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and consolidate or expand our distribution capacity 
as we believe appropriate for our operations and to meet anticipated needs.
Competition
Competition in the athletic apparel industry is based principally on brand image and recognition as well as product 
quality, innovation, style, distribution, and price. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of our premium brand 
image and our technical product innovation. We also believe our ability to introduce new product innovations, combine 
function and fashion, and connect through in-store, online, and community experiences sets us apart from our competition. In 
addition, we believe our vertical retail distribution strategy and community-based marketing differentiates us further, 
allowing us to more effectively control our brand image and connect with our guest.
The market for athletic apparel is highly competitive. It includes increasing competition from established companies 
that are expanding their production and marketing of performance products, as well as from frequent new entrants to the 
market. We are in direct competition with wholesalers and direct sellers of athletic apparel, such as Nike, Inc., adidas AG, 
Under Armour, Inc, and Columbia Sportswear Company. We also compete with retailers who have expanded to include 
women's athletic apparel including The Gap, Inc. (including the Athleta brand), Victoria's Secret with its sport and lounge 
offering, and Urban Outfitters, Inc.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. Our annual net revenue 
is weighted more heavily toward our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season, 
while our operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year. As a result, a substantial portion of our 
operating profits are generated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. For example, we generated approximately 56% and 
47% of our full year operating profit during the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Due to a significant number of 
our company-operated stores being temporarily closed due to COVID-19 during the first two quarters of 2020, we earned a 
higher proportion of our operating profit during the last two quarters of 2020 compared to prior years.

Human Capital 
Our Impact Agenda sets out our social and environmental commitments and strategy — across three interconnected 
pillars, Be Human, Be Well, and Be Planet. The Be Human pillar of our Impact Agenda sets out our focus areas with respect to 
our employees and broader community:
•
advancing a culture of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action (“IDEA”);
•
supporting our employees through whole-person opportunities; and
•
supporting the well-being of the people who make our products in our supply chain. 
In 2020, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also implemented a range of measures to provide financial 
support to our employees and community and to ensure the safety for our people and guests. 
Advancing a culture of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Action
We continually endeavor to create an environment that is equitable, inclusive, and fosters personal growth.
Diversity and inclusion are key components of our culture and are fundamental to achieving our strategic priorities and 
future vision. The diversity of our teams and working in an inclusive culture enables increased employee engagement, better 
decision making, greater adaptability, creativity, and a deeper understanding of the communities we serve. We are proud that 
as of January 31, 2021, approximately 55% of our board of directors, 65% of our senior executive leadership team, and 50% of 
all vice presidents and above are women, while approximately 75% of our overall workforce are women.(1)
We maintain 100% gender pay equity within our entire global employee population, meaning equal pay for equal work 
across genders. We have achieved pay equity across all areas of diversity in the United States and are seeking, to the extent 
permitted under local law and regulation, to collect the data necessary to confirm complete pay equity globally.
We are investing $5 million to fund to our global IDEA activities. These funds can further support the career progress of 
our diverse talent and increase access to internal opportunities and professional development. We offer all employees IDEA 
education, training, and guided conversations on a variety of topics, including anti-racism, anti-discrimination, and inclusive 
leadership behaviors. We aim to foster a culture of inclusion by making IDEA part of our everyday conversation, and 
frequently review our policies, programs, and practices to identify ways to be more inclusive and equitable. 
Supporting our employees through whole-person opportunities
We believe that each of our approximately 25,000 people are key to the success of our business. We strive to foster a 
distinctive culture rooted in our core values that attracts and retains passionate and motivated employees who are driven to 
achieve personal and professional goals. We believe our people succeed because we create an environment that fosters 
growth and is diverse and equitable.
Employees by Region
United States, 60%
Canada, 26%
Outside of North America, 14%
We assess our performance and identify opportunities for improvement through an annual employee engagement 
survey. In 2020, the participation rate was in excess of 90% and our employee engagement score was in the top 10% of 
retailers.(2) Our engagement score tells us whether our employees believe lululemon is a great place to work, whether they 
believe they are able to use their strengths at work, if they are motivated, and whether they would recommend lululemon as 
a great place to work. 
(1) While we track male and female genders, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.
(2) Based on an industry benchmark provided by the third party that administers this survey to our employees. 
6

We understand that health and wealth programs need to offer choice at all stages of life. Our current offerings to 
support whole-person opportunities include, among other things: 
•
Competitive compensation which rewards exceptional performance;
•
A parenthood program which is a gender-neutral benefit that provides all eligible employees up to six months of paid 
leave; 
•
An employee assistance program which provides free, confidential, support to all our employees and their families in 
a variety of areas from mental well-being to financial services to advice for new parents;
•
Personal resilience tools to employees, ambassadors, and suppliers; 
•
Reimbursement programs which reward physical activity; and
•
A Fund your Future program for eligible employees which offers partial contribution matches to a pension plan and 
employee share purchase plan.
Supporting the wellbeing of the people who make our products in our supply chain 
We partner with our suppliers to work towards creating safe, healthy, and equitable environments that support the 
wellbeing of all the people who make our products. Our Vendor Code of Ethics is the foundation of our supplier partnerships. 
It adheres to international standards for working conditions, workers’ rights, and environmental protection, and its 
implementation focuses on prevention, monitoring, and improvement. Beyond labor compliance, we are committed to 
supporting worker wellbeing, building on years of partnerships with our suppliers around workplace practices and community 
support initiatives. 
We recently developed and implemented our Foreign Migrant Worker Standard, which outlines our expectations with 
respect to foreign migrant workers. This program, which has been successfully executed in Taiwan, has benefited 
approximately 2,700 migrant workers by virtually eliminating worker-paid fees. Based on lessons learned from this program, 
we are now expanding beyond Taiwan so that we can further support foreign migrant workers globally. 
Our COVID-19 response
We closely monitor the changing landscape of COVID-19 so that we can make appropriate decisions to support and 
keep our people safe. We acted swiftly during the year in response to the crisis by temporarily closing our stores, committing 
to pay protection for employees, launching our We Stand Together Fund, and launching our Ambassador Relief Fund. 
When our stores temporarily closed, we guaranteed pay to our North American employees through the entire closure 
period. As stores re-opened, we kept a pay guarantee in place, should a store need to close again for any reason, including if 
weather-related or related to civil unrest. We now have a minimum pay guarantee policy by role. 
We created a wide range of resiliency and connection sessions and tools to support our people during the pandemic 
and we made these resources available to our guests and the broader community.
Our We Stand Together Fund was established to support employees facing significant financial hardship with relief 
grants for basic and critical needs. To establish this fund, for three months the senior leadership team contributed 20% of 
their salary and our board of directors contributed 100% of their cash retainer, and employees donated as well. We plan to 
fund this program on an ongoing basis to aid affected employees. Separately, we contributed $4.5 million to our Ambassador 
Relief Fund to assist ambassador-run fitness studios with basic operating costs.
As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to prioritize the safety of our people and our guests. 
We are closely monitoring the situation in every market and community which we serve. We will temporarily close stores and 
restrict operations as necessary, based upon information from government and health officials.
Intellectual Property
We have trademark rights on many of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is 
an important factor in building our brand image and in distinguishing our products from the products of others. We consider 
our lululemon and wave design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. In addition, we own many other 
trademarks for names of several of our brands, slogans, fabrics and products. We own registered and pending U.S. and 
foreign utility and design patents, industrial designs in Canada, and registered community designs in Europe that protect our 
product innovations, distinctive apparel, and accessory designs.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors, as well as additional factors 
not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, should be considered in evaluating our business. Our 
business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these risks.
Risks related to our business and industry
Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand. 
The lululemon name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our expansion strategies. 
Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising 
efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality product, and guest experience. We rely on social media, as one of 
our marketing strategies, to have a positive impact on both our brand value and reputation. Our brand and reputation could 
be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, if our public image was to be tarnished by negative publicity, 
which could be amplified by social media, if we fail to deliver innovative and high quality products acceptable to our guests, or 
if we face or mishandle a product recall. Our reputation could also be impacted by adverse publicity, whether or not valid, 
regarding allegations that we, or persons associated with us or formerly associated with us, have violated applicable laws or 
regulations, including but not limited to those related to safety, employment, discrimination, harassment, whistle-blowing, 
privacy, corporate citizenship, improper business practices, or cybersecurity. Additionally, while we devote considerable effort 
and resources to protecting our intellectual property, if these efforts are not successful the value of our brand may be 
harmed. Any harm to our brand and reputation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
The current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and related government, private sector, and individual consumer responsive 
actions have and will continue to adversely affect our business operations, store traffic, employee availability, financial 
condition, liquidity, and cash flow.
The outbreak of COVID-19 has spread across the United States, Canada, and most other countries globally. Related 
government and private sector responsive actions have significantly affected our business operations and will likely continue 
to do so for the foreseeable future. 
The spread of COVID-19 has caused health officials to impose restrictions and recommend precautions to mitigate the 
spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as malls and lifestyle centers. Our stores 
have experienced temporary closures, and we have implemented precautionary measures in line with guidance from local 
authorities in the stores that are open. These measures include restrictions such as limitations on the number of guests 
allowed in our stores at any single time, minimum physical distancing requirements, and limited operating hours. We do not 
know how the measures recommended by local authorities or implemented by us may change over time or what the duration 
of these restrictions will be.
Further resurgences in COVID-19 cases, including from variants, could cause additional restrictions, including 
temporarily closing all or some of our stores again. An outbreak at one of our locations, even if we follow appropriate 
precautionary measures, could negatively impact our employees, guests, and brand. There is uncertainty over the impact of 
COVID-19 on the U.S., Canadian, and global economies, consumer willingness to visit stores, malls, and lifestyle centers, and 
employee willingness to staff our stores as the pandemic continues and if there are future resurgences. There is also 
uncertainty regarding potential long-term changes to consumer shopping behavior and preferences and whether consumer 
demand will recover when restrictions are lifted.
We may be impacted by other business disruptions related to COVID-19, including disruptions to our sourcing and 
manufacturing or to our distribution facilities. Both of our distribution centers in the United States have experienced 
temporary closures due to COVID-19.
8

The temporary closure of the majority of our retail locations during the first two quarters of 2020, subsequent 
temporary re-closures of certain retail locations, as well as other impacts of COVID-19, have negatively impacted our cash 
flows from operations and our liquidity. The length and severity of the pandemic, as well as the pace of recovery, could 
negatively impact our future cash flows.
The COVID-19 situation is changing rapidly and the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future 
developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning 
the severity of COVID-19 and its variants and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, including vaccinations.
Changes in consumer shopping preferences, and shifts in distribution channels could materially impact our results of 
operations.
We sell our products through a variety of channels, with a significant portion through traditional brick-and-mortar retail 
channels. The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted guest shopping preferences away from brick-and-mortar and towards digital 
platforms. As strong e-commerce channels emerge and develop, we are evolving towards an omni-channel approach to 
support the shopping behavior of our guests. This involves country and region specific websites, social media, product 
notification emails, mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our 
distribution centers, and online order fulfillment through stores. The diversion of sales from our company-operated stores 
could adversely impact our return on investment and could lead to impairment charges and store closures, including lease exit 
costs. We could have difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels. Our failure to successfully 
integrate our digital and physical channels and respond to these risks might adversely impact our business and results of 
operations, as well as damage our reputation and brands.
If any of our products are unacceptable to us or our guests, our business could be harmed.
We have occasionally received, and may in the future receive, shipments of products that fail to comply with our 
technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards. We have also received, and may in the future 
receive, products that are otherwise unacceptable to us or our guests. Under these circumstances, unless we are able to 
obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenue resulting from the inability to sell those 
products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. Additionally, if the unacceptability of our products is not 
discovered until after such products are sold, our guests could lose confidence in our products or we could face a product 
recall and our results of operations could suffer and our business, reputation, and brand could be harmed.
We operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to 
compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenue and 
profitability.
The market for technical athletic apparel is highly competitive. Competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced 
profit margins or lost market share, or a failure to grow or maintain our market share, any of which could substantially harm 
our business and results of operations. We compete directly against wholesalers and direct retailers of athletic apparel, 
including large, diversified apparel companies with substantial market share and established companies expanding their 
production and marketing of technical athletic apparel, as well as against retailers specifically focused on women's athletic 
apparel. We also face competition from wholesalers and direct retailers of traditional commodity athletic apparel, such as 
cotton T-shirts and sweatshirts. Many of our competitors are large apparel and sporting goods companies with strong 
worldwide brand recognition. Because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other apparel sellers, 
including those specializing in yoga apparel and other activewear. Many of our competitors have significant competitive 
advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a 
broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, store development, 
marketing, distribution, and other resources than we do.
Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively 
than we can. In contrast to our grassroots community-based marketing approach, many of our competitors promote their 
brands through traditional forms of advertising, such as print media and television commercials, and through celebrity 
endorsements, and have substantial resources to devote to such efforts. Our competitors may also create and maintain brand 
awareness using traditional forms of advertising more quickly than we can. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales 
in their new and existing markets faster than we do by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do, such as 
catalog sales or an extensive franchise network.
In addition, because we hold limited patents and exclusive intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics or 
processes underlying our products, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with 
performance characteristics, fabrication techniques, and styling similar to our products.
9

Our sales and profitability may decline as a result of increasing product costs and decreasing selling prices.
Our business is subject to significant pressure on costs and pricing caused by many factors, including intense 
competition, constrained sourcing capacity and related inflationary pressure, pressure from consumers to reduce the prices 
we charge for our products, and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to experience increased costs, 
reduce our prices to consumers or experience reduced sales in response to increased prices, any of which could cause our 
operating margin to decline if we are unable to offset these factors with reductions in operating costs and could have a 
material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative, and 
differentiated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales and profitability.
Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to 
changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that 
cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to introduce new products or novel technologies in a timely manner or 
our new products or technologies are not accepted by our guests, our competitors may introduce similar products in a more 
timely fashion, which could hurt our goal to be viewed as a leader in technical athletic apparel innovation. Our new products 
may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of athletic apparel or 
away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond 
to these changes. Our failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, 
among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, 
our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and 
introduce innovative, high-quality products. Our failure to effectively introduce new products that are accepted by consumers 
could result in a decrease in net revenue and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our 
financial condition.
Our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast guest demand for our 
products.
To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers 
based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products 
could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in guest demand for our products or for products of our 
competitors, our failure to accurately forecast guest acceptance of new products, product introductions by competitors, 
unanticipated changes in general market conditions (for example, because of unexpected effects on inventory supply and 
consumer demand caused by the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic), and weakening of economic conditions or 
consumer confidence in future economic conditions. If we fail to accurately forecast guest demand, we may experience excess 
inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale in our stores or for delivery to guests.
Inventory levels in excess of guest demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess 
inventory at discounted prices, which would cause our gross margin to suffer and could impair the strength and exclusivity of 
our brand. Conversely, if we underestimate guest demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver 
products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our reputation and guest relationships.
Our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new international markets may limit our expansion and 
cause our business and growth to suffer.
Our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of North America. We have limited experience with 
regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in 
any new market. In connection with our expansion efforts we may encounter obstacles we did not face in North America, 
including cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices, 
difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments, and foreign guests' tastes and preferences. We 
may also encounter difficulty expanding into new international markets because of limited brand recognition leading to 
delayed acceptance of our technical athletic apparel by guests in these new international markets. Our failure to develop our 
business in new international markets or disappointing growth outside of existing markets could harm our business and 
results of operations.
In addition, we may, from time to time, evaluate and pursue other strategic investments or acquisitions. These involve 
various inherent risks and the benefits sought may not be realized. The acquisition of MIRROR or other strategic investments 
or acquisitions may not create value and may harm our brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and 
results of operations.
10

We may not realize the potential benefits and synergies sought with the acquisition of MIRROR. 
During 2020, we acquired MIRROR as part of our growth plan, which includes driving business through omni-guest 
experiences. The potential benefits of enhancing our digital and interactive capabilities and deepening our roots in the 
sweatlife might not be realized fully, if at all. Further, the expected synergies between lululemon and MIRROR, such as those 
related to our connections with our guests and communities as well as our store and direct to consumer infrastructure, may 
not materialize. A significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and if our acquisition does not yield 
expected returns, we may be required to record impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 
Our management team has limited experience in addressing the challenges of integrating management teams, 
strategies, cultures, and organizations of two companies. This integration may divert the attention of management and cause 
additional expenses. Management also has limited experience outside of the retail industry, including with the specialized 
hardware and software sold and licensed by MIRROR. If MIRROR has inadequate or ineffective controls and procedures, our 
internal control over financial reporting could be adversely impacted. The acquisition may not be well received by the 
customers or employees of either company, and this could hurt our brand and result in the loss of key employees. If we are 
unable to successfully integrate MIRROR, including its people and technologies, we may not be able to manage operations 
efficiently, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The acquisition of MIRROR may also divert management 
time and other resources away from our existing business. 
We may not be able to grow the MIRROR business and have it achieve profitability.
We may be unable to attract and retain subscribers to MIRROR. If we do not provide the delivery and installation 
service that our guests expect, offer engaging and innovative classes, and support and continue to improve the technology 
used, we may not be able to maintain and grow the number of subscribers. This could adversely impact our results of 
operations.
We are dependent on information technology systems to provide live and recorded classes to our customers with 
MIRROR subscriptions, to maintain its software, and to manage subscriptions. If we experience issues such as cybersecurity 
threats or actions, or interruptions or delays in our information technology systems, the data privacy and overall experience 
of subscribers could be negatively impacted and could therefore damage our brand and adversely affect our results of 
operations.
Competition, including from other in-home fitness providers as well as in-person fitness studios, and trends of 
consumer preferences, could also impact the level of subscriptions and therefore our results of operations.
If we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity 
of our business and as a result our brand image and financial performance may suffer.
We have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception in 1998 and our net revenue has increased from 
$40.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $4.4 billion in 2020. If our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience 
difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in 
production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. We 
could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade 
our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space for our expanding 
workforce. This expansion could increase the strain on our resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including 
difficulties in hiring, training, and managing an increasing number of employees. These difficulties could result in the erosion 
of our brand image which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
We are subject to risks associated with leasing retail and distribution space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases.
We lease the majority of our stores under operating leases and our inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease 
terms could impact our ability to grow. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can 
be extended in five-year increments if at all. We generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. If an existing or new store 
is not profitable, and we decide to close it, as we have done in the past and may do in the future, we may nonetheless be 
committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the 
balance of the lease term. Similarly, we may be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable leases even if 
current locations of our stores become unattractive as demographic patterns change. In addition, as each of our leases expire, 
we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could require us to close stores in 
desirable locations.
We also lease the majority of our distribution centers and our inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms 
could impact our ability to deliver our products to the market.
11

We may not be able to successfully open new store locations in a timely manner, if at all, which could harm our results of 
operations.
Our growth will largely depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores, which depends on many 
factors, including, among others, our ability to:
•
identify suitable store locations, the availability of which is outside of our control;
•
gain brand recognition and acceptance, particularly in markets that are new to us;
•
negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances;
•
hire, train and retain store personnel and field management;
•
immerse new store personnel and field management into our corporate culture;
•
source sufficient inventory levels; and
•
successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.
We may be unsuccessful in identifying new markets where our technical athletic apparel and other products and brand 
image will be accepted. In addition, we may not be able to open or profitably operate new stores in existing, adjacent, or new 
markets due to the impact of COVID-19, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our future success is substantially dependent on the service of our senior management and other key employees.
In the last few years, we have had changes to our senior management team including new hires, departures, and role 
and responsibility changes. The performance of our senior management team and other key employees may not meet our 
needs and expectations. Also, the loss of services of any of these key employees, or any negative public perception with 
respect to these individuals, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and could have a negative impact on 
our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. Such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our financial 
performance, financial condition, and the market price of our stock.
Our business is affected by seasonality.
Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. This seasonality may 
adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate.
Risks related to our supply chain
Our reliance on suppliers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products could cause problems if we experience a supply 
chain disruption and we are unable to secure additional suppliers of fabrics or other raw materials, or manufacturers of our 
end products.
We do not manufacture our products or the raw materials for them and rely instead on suppliers. Many of the specialty 
fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed and manufactured by third parties and may 
be available, in the short-term, from only one or a limited number of sources. We have no long-term contracts with any of our 
suppliers or manufacturers for the production and supply of our raw materials and products, and we compete with other 
companies for fabrics, other raw materials, and production. The following statistics are based on cost.
We work with a group of approximately 40 vendors that manufacture our products, five of which produced 59% of our 
products in 2020. During 2020, the largest single manufacturer produced approximately 17% of our products. During 2020, 
approximately 33% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 20% in Cambodia, 12% in Sri Lanka, and 9% in the PRC, 
including 2% in Taiwan.
We work with a group of approximately 65 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. In 2020, 65% of our fabrics 
were produced by our top five fabric suppliers, and the largest single manufacturer produced approximately 29% of fabric 
used. During 2020, approximately 45% of our fabrics originated from Taiwan, 18% from Mainland China, 16% from Sri Lanka, 
and the remainder from other regions. 
We also source other raw materials which are used in our products, including items such as content labels, elastics, 
buttons, clasps, and drawcords from suppliers located predominantly in the Asia Pacific region.
We have experienced, and may in the future experience, a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials 
and may be unable to locate alternative suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, if we 
12

experience significant increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier or manufacturer, we may be unable to 
locate additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, 
or at all, or we may be unable to locate any supplier or manufacturer with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or fill 
our orders in a timely manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with 
its quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to 
expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a 
result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, and quality control standards. 
Our supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could be disrupted or delayed by the impact of health pandemics, 
including the current COVID-19 pandemic, and the related government and private sector responsive actions such as border 
closures, restrictions on product shipments, and travel restrictions. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to 
an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from our markets or from other participants in our 
supply chain. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an 
adverse effect on our ability to meet guest demand for our products and result in lower net revenue and income from 
operations both in the short and long term.
The operations of many of our suppliers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control.
Almost all of our suppliers are located outside of North America, and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with 
doing business abroad, including:
•
the impact of health conditions, including COVID-19, and related government and private sector responsive actions, 
and other changes in local economic conditions in countries where our suppliers or manufacturers are located;
•
political unrest, terrorism, labor disputes, and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign 
countries in which our products are manufactured;
•
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•
the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety 
standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on 
currency exchange or the transfer of funds;
•
reduced protection for intellectual property rights, including trademark protection, in some countries, particularly in 
the PRC; and
•
disruptions or delays in shipments whether due to port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations and/or 
inspections or other factors, natural disasters or health pandemics, or other transportation disruptions.
These and other factors beyond our control could interrupt our suppliers' production in offshore facilities, influence the 
ability of our suppliers to export our products cost-effectively or at all and inhibit our suppliers' ability to procure certain 
materials, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our business could be harmed if our suppliers and manufacturers do not comply with our Vendor Code of Ethics or 
applicable laws.
While we require our suppliers and manufacturers to comply with our Vendor Code of Ethics, which includes labor, 
health and safety, and environment standards, we do not control their practices. If suppliers or contractors do not comply 
with these standards or applicable laws or there is negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our 
suppliers or manufacturers, even if unfounded or not material to our supply chain, our reputation and sales could be 
adversely affected, we could be subject to legal liability, or we could be forced to locate alternative suppliers or 
manufacturing sources.
The fluctuating cost of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold.
The fabrics used to make our products include synthetic fabrics whose raw materials include petroleum-based products. 
Our products also include silver and natural fibers, including cotton. Our costs for raw materials are affected by, among other 
things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the 
currencies of producer versus consumer countries, and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. 
Increases in the cost of raw materials, including petroleum or the prices we pay for silver and our cotton yarn and cotton-
based textiles, could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold, results of operations, financial condition, and 
cash flows.
13

If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market and to meet guest 
expectations could be harmed.
We rely on our distribution facilities for substantially all of our product distribution. Our distribution facilities include 
computer controlled and automated equipment, which means their operations may be subject to a number of risks related to 
security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions, or other 
system failures. In addition, our operations could also be interrupted by labor difficulties, extreme or severe weather 
conditions or by floods, fires, or other natural disasters near our distribution centers. If we encounter problems with our 
distribution system, our ability to meet guest expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve objectives for 
operating efficiencies could be harmed.
Increasing labor costs and other factors associated with the production of our products in South Asia and South East Asia 
could increase the costs to produce our products.
A significant portion of our products are produced in South Asia and South East Asia and increases in the costs of labor 
and other costs of doing business in the countries in this area could significantly increase our costs to produce our products 
and could have a negative impact on our operations and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business include 
labor shortages and increases in labor costs, difficulties and additional costs in transporting products manufactured from 
these countries to our distribution centers and significant revaluation of the currencies used in these countries, which may 
result in an increase in the cost of producing products. Also, the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations against 
products imported by us from, or the loss of "normal trade relations" status with any country in which our products are 
manufactured, could significantly increase our cost of products and harm our business.
Risks related to information security and technology
We may be unable to safeguard against security breaches or comply with data privacy laws which could damage our 
customer relationships and result in significant legal and financial exposure.
As part of our normal operations, we receive confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including 
credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our 
business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our 
safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of theft or misuse of this 
information, and could result in litigation and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many 
recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to be able to anticipate or prevent rapidly 
evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us 
with information. In addition, despite taking measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from 
security breaches, our customers and our business could still be exposed to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to 
incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage 
third party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments 
may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we 
implement to protect against cyber-attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers' shopping experience or 
decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result 
of non-technical issues including intentional or inadvertent breach by employees or persons with whom we have commercial 
relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our 
security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and damage to 
our brand and reputation or other harm to our business.
Additionally, we are subject to laws and regulations such as the European Union's General Data Privacy Regulation 
("GDPR") and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). These regulations require companies to satisfy new requirements 
regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection, and the ability of persons whose data is 
stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of 
up to four percent of worldwide revenue. The GDPR, CCPA, and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated 
inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, increase our operating costs, 
require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines, 
negative publicity, or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.
Disruption of our information technology systems or unexpected network interruption could disrupt our business.
We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and third-parties to operate our e-commerce 
websites, process transactions, respond to guest inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis, 
and maintain cost-efficient operations. The failure of our information technology systems to operate properly or effectively, 
problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or difficulty in integrating new systems, could adversely 
14

affect our business. In addition, we have e-commerce websites in the United States, Canada, and internationally. Our 
information technology systems, websites, and operations of third parties on whom we rely, may encounter damage or 
disruption or slowdown caused by a failure to successfully upgrade systems, system failures, viruses, computer "hackers", 
natural disasters, or other causes. These could cause information, including data related to guest orders, to be lost or delayed 
which could, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during the holiday season, result in delays in the delivery of 
products to our stores and guests or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our products and cause our sales to decline. 
The concentration of our primary offices, two of our distribution centers, and a number of our stores along the west coast of 
North America could amplify the impact of a natural disaster occurring in that area to our business, including to our 
information technology systems. In addition, if changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if 
our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose guests. We have limited back-up systems and 
redundancies, and our information technology systems and websites have experienced system failures and electrical outages 
in the past which have disrupted our operations. Any significant disruption in our information technology systems or websites 
could harm our reputation and credibility, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and 
results of operations. 
Our technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online may not function effectively.
Many of our customers shop with us through our e-commerce websites and mobile apps. Increasingly, customers are 
using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are 
increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile apps to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their 
shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that 
offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of 
online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our 
reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could 
have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Risks related to environmental, social, and governance issues
Climate change, and related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, may adversely impact our business.
There is increasing concern that a gradual rise in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, 
an increase in the frequency, severity, and duration of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and water scarcity 
and poor water quality. These events could adversely impact the cultivation of cotton, which is a key resource in the 
production of our products, disrupt the operation of our supply chain and the productivity of our contract manufacturers, 
increase our production costs, impose capacity restraints and impact the types of apparel products that consumers purchase. 
These events could also compound adverse economic conditions and impact consumer confidence and discretionary 
spending. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of 
operations. In many countries, governmental bodies are enacting new or additional legislation and regulations to reduce or 
mitigate the potential impacts of climate change. If we, our suppliers, or our contract manufacturers are required to comply 
with these laws and regulations, or if we choose to take voluntary steps to reduce or mitigate our impact on climate change, 
we may experience increases in energy, production, transportation, and raw material costs, capital expenditures, or insurance 
premiums and deductibles, which could adversely impact our operations. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations among 
jurisdictions may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Any assessment of the potential impact 
of future climate change legislation, regulations or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is 
uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries in which we operate.
Increased scrutiny from investors and others regarding our environmental, social, governance, or sustainability, 
responsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation, employee retention, and 
willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.
Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, stockholders, and 
customers have focused increasingly on the environmental, social and governance ("ESG") or “sustainability” practices of 
companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our 
ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our 
brand, reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted based on an assessment of our ESG practices. Any 
sustainability report that we publish or otherwise sustainability disclosure we make may include our policies and practices on 
a variety of social and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and 
safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management, and workforce inclusion and 
diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could 
15

also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. Also, 
our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure could negatively impact our 
reputation, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.
Risks related to global economic, political, and regulatory conditions
An economic recession, depression, downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets may adversely affect consumer 
discretionary spending and demand for our products.
Many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Some of the factors that may influence 
consumer spending on discretionary items include general economic conditions (particularly those in North America), high 
levels of unemployment, health pandemics (such as the impact of the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, including 
reduced store traffic and widespread temporary closures of retail locations), higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net 
worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and 
foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, 
fluctuating commodity prices, tax rates and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. To date, 
COVID-19 and related restrictions and mitigation measures have negatively impacted the global economy and created 
significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. While the duration and severity of the economic impact of COVID-19 
is unknown, any recession, depression or general downturn in the global economy will negatively affect consumer confidence 
and discretionary spending. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in 
consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and 
uncertainties about the future. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our 
products. Consumer demand for our products may not reach our targets, or may decline, when there is an economic 
downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets, particularly in North America. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and 
any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Global economic and political conditions and global events such as health pandemics could adversely impact our results of 
operations.
Uncertain or challenging global economic and political conditions could impact our performance, including our ability to 
successfully expand internationally. Global economic conditions could impact levels of consumer spending in the markets in 
which we operate, which could impact our sales and profitability. Political unrest could negatively impact our guests and 
employees, reduce consumer spending, and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Health pandemics, such 
as the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and the related governmental, private sector and individual consumer 
responses could contribute to a recession, depression, or global economic downturn, reduce store traffic and consumer 
spending, result in temporary or permanent closures of retail locations, offices, and factories, and could negatively impact the 
flow of goods.
We may be unable to source and sell our merchandise profitably or at all if new trade restrictions are imposed or existing 
restrictions become more burdensome.
The United States and the countries in which our products are produced or sold have imposed and may impose 
additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty, or tariff 
levels. The results of any audits or related disputes regarding these restrictions or regulations could have an adverse effect on 
our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. Countries impose, 
modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national 
economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other 
trade restrictions. Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase 
the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us, could increase shipping times, or may require us to modify our 
supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and 
results of operations.
We are dependent on international trade agreements and regulations. The countries in which we produce and sell our 
products could impose or increase tariffs, duties, or other similar charges that could negatively affect our results of 
operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
Adverse changes in, or withdrawal from, trade agreements or political relationships between the United States and the 
PRC, Canada, or other countries where we sell or source our products, could negatively impact our results of operations or 
cash flows. Any tariffs imposed between the United States and the PRC could increase the costs of our products. General 
geopolitical instability and the responses to it, such as the possibility of sanctions, trade restrictions, and changes in tariffs, 
including recent sanctions against the PRC, tariffs imposed by the United States and the PRC, and the possibility of additional 
16

tariffs or other trade restrictions between the United States and Mexico, could adversely impact our business. It is possible 
that further tariffs may be introduced, or increased. Such changes could adversely impact our business and could increase the 
costs of sourcing our products from the PRC, or could require us to source more of our products from other countries. 
There could be changes in economic conditions in the United Kingdom ("UK") or European Union ("EU"), including due 
to the UK's withdrawal from the EU, foreign exchange rates, and consumer markets. Our business could be adversely affected 
by these changes, including by additional duties on the importation of our products into the UK from the EU and as a result of 
shipping delays or congestion.
Changes in tax laws or unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.
We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, Canada, and several other foreign jurisdictions. Our 
effective income tax rates could be unfavorably impacted by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings 
amongst countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in 
tax laws, new tax interpretations and guidance, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, 
and any repatriation of unremitted earnings for which we have not previously accrued applicable U.S. income taxes and 
foreign withholding taxes. We may face unanticipated tax liabilities in connection with our acquisition of MIRROR.
Repatriations from our Canadian subsidiaries are not subject to Canadian withholding taxes if such distributions are 
made as a return of capital. We have not accrued for any Canadian withholding taxes that could be payable on future 
repatriations from our Canadian subsidiaries because we believe the current net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries can 
either be repatriated free of withholding tax or is expected to be indefinitely reinvested. The extent to which future increases 
in the net assets of our Canadian subsidiaries can be repatriated free of withholding tax is dependent on, among other things, 
the amount of paid-up-capital in our Canadian subsidiaries and transactions undertaken by our exchangeable shareholders. 
We are unable to determine the timing and extent to which such transactions may occur. Accordingly, increases in our 
Canadian net assets may result in an increase to our effective tax rate.
We and our subsidiaries engage in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we 
believe that these transactions reflect the accurate economic allocation of profit and that proper transfer pricing 
documentation is in place, the profit allocation and transfer pricing terms and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax 
authorities during an audit and any resulting changes may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax 
rates.
Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States and Canada, 
subject to significant change. Changes in applicable U.S., Canadian, or other foreign tax laws and regulations, or their 
interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our income tax expense and 
profitability, as they did in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 upon passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators 
and negative publicity.
The labeling, distribution, importation, marketing, and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by 
various federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission and state attorneys 
general in the United States, the Competition Bureau and Health Canada in Canada, as well as by various other federal, state, 
provincial, local, and international regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are distributed or sold. If we 
fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could become subject to enforcement actions or the imposition of significant 
penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. In addition, any audits 
and inspections by governmental agencies related to these matters could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, 
fines, or other penalties, divert financial and management resources, and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable 
outcome of any particular proceeding could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of 
operations. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in 
significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and could impair the marketing of our products, resulting in 
significant loss of net revenue.
Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and 
other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. In many countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it 
may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the 
FCPA or other U.S. and international laws and regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented procedures 
designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, some of our employees, agents, or other partners, as well as 
those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, could take actions in violation of our policies. Any 
such violation could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
17

Because a significant portion of our net revenue and expenses are generated in countries other than the United States, 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected our results of operations and may continue to do so in the 
future.
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial 
statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our foreign 
subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect 
the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on 
translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign currency translation 
adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity. 
We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our 
subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and 
inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we 
have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of 
currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.
Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully 
offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements.
We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to forward currency 
contracts used in our hedging strategies.
Risks related to intellectual property
Our fabrics and manufacturing technology generally are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. If our 
competitors sell products similar to ours at lower prices, our net revenue and profitability could suffer.
The intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics, and processes used to manufacture our products generally 
are owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. Our ability to obtain intellectual property 
protection for our products is therefore limited and we do not generally own patents or hold exclusive intellectual property 
rights in the technology, fabrics or processes underlying our products. As a result, our current and future competitors are able 
to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, fabrics and styling similar to our products. Because many 
of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do, they may be 
able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. If our 
competitors sell products similar to ours at lower prices, our net revenue and profitability could suffer.
Our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our 
competitive position.
We currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade dress, and unfair competition laws, as well as 
confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we 
take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of these rights by others, 
including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. In addition, intellectual property protection may be 
unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our intellectual 
property rights as fully as in the United States or Canada, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use 
of our intellectual property rights by other parties in these countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual 
property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished, and our competitive position may suffer.
Our trademarks and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented 
from selling some of our products.
Our success depends in large part on our brand image. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and 
creating and sustaining demand for our products. We have applied for and obtained some United States, Canada, and foreign 
trademark registrations, and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. However, 
some or all of these pending trademark applications may not be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. 
Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. 
Additionally, we may face obstacles as we expand our product line and the geographic scope of our sales and marketing. Third 
parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products 
we offer. Our defense of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming and could divert 
management resources. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us 
18

from selling some of our products. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights 
from third parties, or cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events could harm our business and cause our results 
of operations, liquidity, and financial condition to suffer.
Risks related to legal and governance matters
We are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved 
against us.
From time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to product liability 
claims, stockholder class action and derivative claims, commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, 
regulatory, employment, and other claims related to our business. Any of these proceedings could result in significant 
settlement amounts, damages, fines, or other penalties, divert financial and management resources, and result in significant 
legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could exceed the limits of our insurance policies or the 
carriers may decline to fund such final settlements and/or judgments and could have an adverse impact on our business, 
financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our 
guests and our brand image.
Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders or others.
We may be subject to actions or proposals from stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies 
or the interests of our other stockholders. Responding to such actions can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business 
and operations, and divert the attention of our board of directors, management, and employees from the pursuit of our 
business strategies. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan. Activist stockholders or others 
may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our 
competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and potential guests, and may affect our 
relationships with current guests, vendors, investors, and other third parties. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of 
directors at our annual meeting would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require 
significant time and attention by management and our board of directors. The perceived uncertainties as to our future 
direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities.
Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay and discourage 
takeover attempts that stockholders may consider to be favorable.
Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of the Delaware General 
Corporation Law may make it more difficult or impossible for a third-party to acquire control of us or effect a change in our 
board of directors and management. These provisions include:
•
the classification of our board of directors into three classes, with one class elected each year;
•
prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;
•
the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;
•
the ability to remove a director only for cause and only with the vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting 
stock;
•
a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our chairman or Chief Executive Officer, or upon a 
resolution adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors, and not by our stockholders;
•
prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and
•
our stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to our 
board of directors or to place stockholder proposals on the agenda for consideration at any meeting of our 
stockholders.
In addition, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to some specified 
exceptions, prohibits "business combinations" between a Delaware corporation and an "interested stockholder," which is 
generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation's voting stock, 
for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the 
effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best 
interests.

On January 31, 2019, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million of our common shares on the open market or 
in privately negotiated transactions. On December 1, 2020, our board of directors approved an increase in the remaining authorization of our existing 
stock repurchase program from $264 million to $500 million. The repurchase plan has no time limit. Common shares repurchased on the open market 
are at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934. The timing and actual number of common shares to be repurchased will depend upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.

Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but 
occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2020 and 2019 were each 52-week years. 
This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, 
uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions included in the "Special Note 
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those 
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in the "Item 1A. Risk 
Factors" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations 
website (http://investor.lululemon.com/), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press 
releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.
Overview
Fiscal 2020 was a year in which we had to adapt our priorities, and evolve our strategies, to navigate the challenges of 
the COVID-19 pandemic and begin to more impactfully address systemic inequities in our society.
We put three foundational principles in place to help guide us through the pandemic. These principles are: 1) protect 
our people to ensure their health, safety, and well-being, 2) make balanced decisions including investing in our digital and 
omni capabilities while tightly managing discretionary expenses, and 3) continue to invest in our future. 
We completed our first acquisition in 2020, with our purchase of MIRROR. MIRROR bolsters our digital sweatlife 
offerings and brings immersive and personalized at-home sweat and mindfulness solutions to new and existing lululemon 
guests.
In addition, we established IDEA – our commitment to Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action – to help drive lasting 
change both within our company and the communities in which we operate. In October 2020, we released our Impact Agenda 
detailing our strategies to become a more sustainable and equitable business, to minimize our environmental impact, and to 
accelerate positive change both internally and externally. 
The Power of Three
Despite the global pandemic, we remain committed to our Power of Three growth plan and the targets contemplated 
by this plan which include a doubling of our men's business, a doubling of our e-commerce business, and a quadrupling of our 
international business by 2023 from levels realized in 2018. Due to a shift towards online shopping as a result of COVID-19, we 
exceeded our e-commerce goal this year.
In addition to the growth targets, the three strategic pillars of the plan also remain unchanged and include: product 
innovation, omni-guest experience, and market expansion.
23

Product Innovation
We continued to leverage our Science of Feel development platform and brought innovations to our guests including a 
relaunch of our Everlux fabric and an expansion of our Align franchise into tops. We also brought newness into our bra 
offering and expanded our On the Move assortment. We introduced more inclusive sizing into our core women's styles in 
2020 with additional styles to be added in 2021. In men's, our guests responded well to shorts, sweats, hoodies, and joggers 
as they adapted their wardrobes to working and sweating from home.
Omni-Guest Experience
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the way guests interacted with our brand in 2020. Temporary store closures, social 
distancing requirements, and other actions taken within our stores to keep our guests and employees safe, contributed to a 
decline in store traffic relative to 2019. Revenue in stores decreased 34%. However, this was offset by significant strength in 
our e-commerce business. We invested in IT infrastructure, fulfillment capacity, and increased the number of educators 
assisting guests in our Guest Education Center, including an online digital educator experience to provide a more personalized 
shopping experience. In addition, we used our social channels to engage with our guests by offering ambassador-led digital 
sweat sessions, meditation classes, and other recovery and well-being tools. Revenue in our e-commerce channel increased 
101% in 2020.
In 2020, as it was safe to welcome guests back into our stores, we launched several initiatives to enhance the in-store 
experience. We adapted our Buy Online Pick-up In-store capability to allow guests to pick-up their purchases at the door of 
the store or at curbside, we implemented virtual waitlist capabilities so that guests did not have to physically wait in line to 
enter stores operating under strict capacity constraints, and we offered appointment shopping in-store.
Market Expansion
We continued to expand our presence both in North America and in our international markets. During the year, we 
opened 30 net new company-operated stores, including 18 stores in Asia Pacific, nine stores in North America, and three 
stores in Europe. 
We also expanded our seasonal store strategy in 2020 with over 100 seasonal stores in operation for some period of 
time during the year. These stores allowed us to better cater to our guests in select markets, while also helping introduce new 
guests to our brand. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we opened 11 of these stores in close proximity to permanent 
lululemon stores. Having two stores in select locations, where locally mandated capacity constraints were contributing to long 
wait times, allowed guests quicker and easier access to our in-store shopping experience. 
For 2020, our business in North America increased 8%, while total growth in our international markets was 31%.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 
and it has caused governments and public health officials to impose restrictions and to recommend precautions to mitigate 
the spread of the virus.
Throughout the pandemic we have prioritized the safety of our employees and guests. 
In February and March, we temporarily closed all of our retail locations in Mainland China, North America, Europe, and 
certain countries in Asia Pacific. Our retail locations in Mainland China reopened during the first quarter of 2020, and our 
retail locations in other markets began reopening during the second quarter of 2020. Almost all locations were open during 
the third quarter of 2020, and while most of our retail locations have remained open since then, certain locations have 
temporarily closed based on government and health authority guidance in those markets. 
Our distribution centers and most of our open retail locations are operating with restrictive and precautionary 
measures in place such as reduced operating hours, physical distancing, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, and limited 
occupancy levels.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, guest shopping preferences were shifting towards digital platforms and we had been 
investing in our websites, mobile apps, and omni-channel capabilities. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic further shifted 
guest shopping behaviour and we saw significant increases in traffic to our websites and digital apps. This increased traffic 
contributed to the significant growth in our direct to consumer net revenue in 2020. While we expect our direct to consumer 
business to grow, we expect the year over year growth rate in direct to consumer net revenue to moderate in 2021. 
24

The COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse impact on our results of operations for 2020 and there remains 
significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our 
operations. Continued proliferation of the virus, resurgence, or the emergence of new variants may result in further or 
prolonged closures of our retail locations and distribution centers, reduce operating hours, interrupt our supply chain, cause 
changes in guest behavior, and reduce discretionary spending. Such factors are beyond our control and could elicit further 
actions and recommendations from governments and public health authorities.
We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities and our Power of Three growth plan and believe that we 
have sufficient cash and cash equivalents, and available capacity under our committed revolving credit facility, to meet our 
liquidity needs. As of January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion and the capacity under our 
committed revolving credit facility was $397.6 million.

Comparison of 2020 to 2019 
Net Revenue
Net revenue increased $422.6 million, or 11%, to $4.4 billion in 2020 from $4.0 billion in 2019. On a constant dollar 
basis, assuming the average exchange rates in 2020 remained constant with the average exchange rates in 2019, net revenue 
increased $412.7 million, or 10%.
The increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in direct to consumer net revenue, partially due to a shift 
in the way guests are shopping due to COVID-19, as well as net revenue from MIRROR. This was partially offset by a decrease 
in company-operated store net revenue, as well as a decrease in net revenue from our other retail locations driven by 
temporary closures as a result of COVID-19 as well as reduced operating hours and restricted guest occupancy levels.
Net revenue for 2020 and 2019 is summarized below.

Company-Operated Stores. The decrease in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment was primarily due 
to the impact of COVID-19. All of our stores in North America, Europe, and certain countries in Asia Pacific were temporarily 
closed for a significant portion of the first two quarters of 2020. Certain stores experienced temporary re-closures during the 
last two quarters of 2020. COVID-19 restrictions, including reduced operating hours and occupancy limits, reduced net 
revenue from company-operated stores that have reopened. 
During 2020, we opened 30 net new company-operated stores, including 18 stores in Asia Pacific, nine stores in North 
America, and three stores in Europe.
Direct to Consumer. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 101%, and increased 101% on a constant dollar basis. 
The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic, and improved 
conversion rates, partially offset by a decrease in dollar value per transaction. The increase in traffic was partially due to 
COVID-19, with more guests shopping online instead of in-stores. During the second quarter of 2020, we held an online 
warehouse sale in the United States and Canada which generated net revenue of $43.3 million. We did not hold any 
warehouse sales during 2019. 
Other. The increase in net revenue from our other operations was primarily the result of net revenue from MIRROR as 
well as an increased number of temporary locations, including seasonal stores, that were open during 2020 compared to 
2019. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in outlet sales primarily due to the impact of COVID-19.

The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of:
•
a decrease in occupancy and depreciation costs as a percentage of net revenue of 60 basis points, driven primarily 
by the increase in net revenue; 
•
a decrease in costs related to our product departments as a percentage of revenue of 50 basis points, driven by 
lower incentive compensation and travel costs, as well as the increase in net revenue; and
•
a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 basis points.
The increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in costs as a percentage of net revenue related to our 
distribution centers of 80 basis points. This was primarily due to an increase in costs related to COVID-19 safety precautions, 
higher people costs related to the growth in our direct to consumer business, and increased usage of third-party warehouse 
and logistics providers. There was also a decrease in product margin of 30 basis points, which was primarily due to higher 
markdowns and air freight costs, partially offset by a favorable mix of higher margin product.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:
•
an increase in costs related to our operating channels of $253.2 million, comprised of:
–
an increase in variable costs of $144.1 million primarily due to an increase in distribution costs related to the 
growth in our direct to consumer net revenue, and an increase in credit card fees as a result of increased net 
revenue; 
–
an increase in brand and community costs of $116.4 million primarily due to an increase in digital marketing 
expenses;
–
an increase in other costs of $14.2 million primarily due to increases in information technology costs; and
–
a decrease in employee costs of $21.5 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses in 
our company-operated stores and other channels. This was partially offset by an increase in salaries and 
wages as a result of increased headcount and labor hours in our direct to consumer and other operations;
•
an increase in head office costs of $56.5 million, comprised of:
–
an increase of $63.0 million primarily due to increases in information technology costs, professional fees, 
depreciation, community giving, and other head office costs; and
–
a decrease in employee costs of $6.5 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation and travel 
expenses, partially offset by increased salaries and wages expense as a result of headcount growth, and 
higher stock-based compensation expense; and
•
an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative revaluation losses of $1.6 million.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by $36.5 million of government payroll 
subsidies. These payroll subsidies partially offset the wages paid to employees while our retail locations were temporarily 
closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As a result of our acquisition of MIRROR in the second quarter of 2020, we recognized acquisition-related compensation 
of $20.1 million for deferred consideration for certain continuing MIRROR employees. We also recognized transaction and 
integration related costs of $10.5 million for advisory and professional services, and integration costs subsequent to the 
acquisition. Acquisition-related expenses were partially offset by a $0.8 million gain recognized on our existing investment. 
We did not have acquisition-related expenses in 2019. Please refer to Note 6. Acquisition included in Item 8 of Part II of this 
report for further information.
Income from Operations
On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate 
expenses. During the first quarter of 2020, we reviewed our segment and general corporate expenses and determined certain 
costs that are more appropriately classified in different categories. Accordingly, comparative figures have been reclassified to 
conform to the financial presentation adopted for the current year.
Segmented income from operations before general corporate expenses is summarized below.

Company-Operated Stores. The decrease in income from operations from company-operated stores was primarily the 
result of decreased gross profit of $591.8 million which was primarily due to lower net revenue as well as lower gross margin. 
The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to deleverage on occupancy and depreciation costs as a result of lower net 
revenue. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, 
primarily due to lower people costs and lower operating costs. People costs decreased primarily due to lower incentive 
compensation. Store operating costs decreased primarily due to lower credit card fees, packaging and supplies, and 
distribution costs as a result of lower net revenue, as well as lower community, security, and repairs and maintenance costs. 
The recognition of certain government payroll subsidies also reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses. Income 
from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue decreased primarily due to lower gross margin and 
deleverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.
Direct to Consumer. The increase in income from operations from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the 
result of increased gross profit of $773.7 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue and due to higher gross 
margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily 
due to higher variable costs including distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging and supplies costs as a result of higher 
net revenue, as well as higher digital marketing expenses, employee costs and information technology costs. Income from 
operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has increased primarily due to leverage on selling, general and 
administrative expenses and an increase in gross margin.
Other. The decrease in income from operations was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative 
expenses, driven primarily by MIRROR digital marketing expenses, as well as increased distribution costs and credit card fees 
28

as a result of revenue generated by MIRROR. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset 
by an increase in gross profit related to MIRROR, driven by increased net revenue. Income from operations as a percentage of 
other net revenue decreased primarily due to deleverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.
General Corporate Expenses. The increase in general corporate expenses was primarily the result of increases in 
information technology costs, salaries and wages as a result of headcount growth, professional fees, depreciation, community 
giving, and an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative losses of $1.6 million. The increase in general corporate 
expense was partially offset by a decrease in travel and incentive compensation costs, as well as the recognition of certain 
government payroll subsidies. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our 
overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our operations.

Our effective tax rate for 2020 was consistent with 2019. This included an increase in the effective tax rate due to

This was offset by adjustments upon filing of certain income tax returns and an increase in tax deductions related to stock-

gross profit of $240.6 million, and a decrease in income tax expense of $21.4 million.
Comparable Store Sales and Total Comparable Sales
We use comparable store sales to assess the performance of our existing stores as it allows us to monitor the 
performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or expanded stores. We use total comparable sales to 
evaluate the performance of our business from an omni-channel perspective. We therefore believe that investors would 
similarly find these metrics useful in assessing the performance of our business. However, as the temporary store closures 
from COVID-19 resulted in a significant number of stores being removed from our comparable store calculations during the 
first two quarters of 2020, we believe total comparable sales and comparable store sales on a full year basis are not currently 
representative of the underlying trends of our business. We do not believe these full year metrics are currently useful to 
investors in understanding performance, therefore we have not included these metrics in our discussion and analysis of 
results of operations. We did not provide comparable sales metrics that included the first two quarters during 2020, and 
expect to do the same for 2021.
Comparable store sales reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open, or open after being 
significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales 
29

beginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store 
sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have not 
been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months, and from stores which have been temporarily 
relocated for renovations or temporarily closed. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer and our 
other operations, as well as sales from company-operated stores that have closed.
Total comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales. 
In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of comparable sales. In the 
year following a 53 week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. 
Opening new stores and expanding existing stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total 
comparable sales is just one way of assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the 
performance of stores opened, or significantly expanded, within the last 12 full fiscal months. The comparable sales measures 
we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Constant dollar changes in net revenue and direct to consumer net revenue are non-GAAP financial measures.
A constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average 
foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in our results to help 
investors understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with 
greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the 
non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly 
comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.
The below changes in net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and 
capacity under our committed revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new 
stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, investing in information technology and making system enhancements, 
funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and 
internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our 
needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions, as well as in money market funds, treasury bills, and 
term deposits.
We believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us 
under our committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure 
requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand 
for our products as well as the other factors described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors". In addition, we may make discretionary 
capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase 
shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of 
debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures 
out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.
Capital expenditures are expected to range between $335.0 million and $345.0 million in fiscal 2021.

As of January 31, 2021, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $90.7 million, our cash and cash 
equivalents were $1.2 billion and our capacity under our committed revolving credit facility was $397.6 million.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $134.0 million to $803.3 million in 2020 from $669.3 million in 2019, 
primarily as a result of the following:
•
an increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $146.5 million, primarily due to the following:
–
$97.5 million related to accounts payable, partially due to a change in payment terms with our non-product 
vendors;
–
$76.8 million related to other accrued liabilities, primarily due to increases in accrued duty, freight, and other 
operating expenses as well as an increase in the sales return allowance as a result of COVID-19 reducing in-
period returns;
–
$38.7 million related to inventories; and
–
$12.1 million related to other current and non-current liabilities.
The increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by the following:
–
$38.4 million related to prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets, including increases in cloud 
computing implementation costs; 
–
$32.0 million related to accrued compensation and related expenses due to lower accrued incentive 
compensation, partially offset by acquisition-related compensation accruals; and
–
$8.2 million related to income taxes.
•
an increase of $44.2 million in adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities 
other than changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily related to an increase in depreciation and 
amortization, deferred income taxes, the settlement of derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship, and 
stock-based compensation.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease of $56.7 million in net income.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities increased $417.1 million, to $695.5 million in 2020 from $278.4 million in 2019. The 
increase was primarily due to the acquisition of MIRROR, net of cash acquired for $452.6 million during 2020. This was 
partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures. 
Capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $134.2 million and $171.5 million in 2020 and 
2019, respectively. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the 
remodeling or relocation of certain stores, for opening new company-operated stores, and ongoing store refurbishment. The 
decrease in capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment was primarily due to fewer store renovations 
during 2020 in comparison with 2019. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment also included $41.0 
million to open 40 company-operated stores and $44.3 million to open 57 company-operated stores, in 2020 and 2019 
31

respectively. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we delayed certain store renovations and new store openings. We expect 
to open between 40 and 50 company-operated stores in 2021.
Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $37.2 million and $15.8 million in 2020 and 2019, 
respectively. We accelerated our investments in our e-commerce websites and mobile apps during 2020 in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it had on guest shopping behavior. The capital expenditures in 2020 were primarily 
related to enhancing the functionality and capacity of our websites, and in 2019 were primarily related to our then new 
distribution center in Toronto, Canada as well as other information technology infrastructure and system initiatives.
Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $57.8 million and $95.7 million in 2020 and 2019, 
respectively. The capital expenditures in each fiscal year were primarily related to investments in information technology and 
business systems, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores. The 
decrease in capital expenditures for our corporate activities and other was partially due to more larger scale projects in the 
prior year in comparison to the current year as well as a shift to cloud computing. Implementation costs related to cloud 
service arrangements are capitalized within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and the associated 
cash flows are included in operating activities. We anticipate that we will continue to shift towards more cloud-based 
technology services in the future.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities decreased $96.4 million, to $80.8 million in 2020 from $177.2 million in 2019. The 
decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in our stock repurchases.
During 2020, 0.4 million shares were repurchased at a cost of $63.7 million. During 2019, 1.1 million shares, were 
repurchased at a cost of $173.4 million. In the first quarter of 2019, we repurchased 1.0 million shares in a private transaction. 
We did not purchase any shares in private transactions during 2020. The other common stock was repurchased in the open 
market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market 
conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.
Revolving Credit Facilities
North America revolving credit facility
During 2016, we obtained a $150.0 million committed and unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with major 
financial institutions. On June 6, 2018, we amended the credit agreement to provide for (i) an increase in the aggregate 
commitments under the revolving credit facility to $400.0 million, with an increase of the sub-limits for the issuance of letters 
of credit and extensions of swing line loans to $50.0 million for each, (ii) an increase in the option, subject to certain 
conditions, to request increases in commitments from $400.0 million to $600.0 million and (iii) an extension in the maturity of 
the facility from December 15, 2021 to June 6, 2023. Borrowings under the facility may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, 
Canadian Dollars, and in other currencies, subject to the lenders' approval.
As of January 31, 2021, aside from letters of credit of $2.4 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this 
credit facility.
Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) based on the rates applicable for 
deposits on the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the borrowings are made ("LIBOR") or (b) 
an alternate base rate, plus, an applicable margin determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the ratio of 
indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and rent ("EBITDAR") and ranges between 
1.00%-1.50% for LIBOR loans and 0.00%-0.50% for alternate base rate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 
0.10%-0.20% is payable on the average unused amounts under the revolving credit facility, and fees of 1.00%-1.50% are 
payable on unused letters of credit.
The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the 
ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all or 
substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and 
distributions. 
We are also required to maintain a consolidated rent-adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5:1 and to maintain 
the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) below 2:1. The credit agreement also contains 
certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among others, an 
event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the 
covenants of the credit facility.
32

Mainland China revolving credit facility
In December 2019, we entered into an uncommitted and unsecured 130.0 million Chinese Yuan revolving credit facility 
with terms that are reviewed on an annual basis. The credit facility was increased to 230.0 million Chinese Yuan during 2020. 
It comprises of a revolving loan of up to 200.0 million Chinese Yuan and a financial guarantee facility of up to 30.0 million 
Chinese Yuan, or its equivalent in another currency. Loans are available for a period not to exceed 12 months, at an interest 
rate equal to the loan prime rate plus a spread of 0.5175%. We are required to follow certain covenants. As of January 31, 
2021, we were in compliance with the covenant and there were no borrowings or guarantees outstanding under this credit 
facility.
364-Day revolving credit facility
In June 2020, we obtained a 364-day $300.0 million committed and unsecured revolving credit facility. In December 
2020, we elected to terminate this credit facility.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Leases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-
cancellable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can be 
extended in five-year increments, if at all. The following table details our future minimum lease payments. Minimum lease 
commitments exclude variable lease expenses including contingent rent payments, common area maintenance, property 
taxes, and landlord's insurance. 
Purchase obligations. The amounts listed for purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including 
open purchase orders) to purchase products and for other expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are 
enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, values are subject to change, such as for 
product purchases throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude liabilities included in our consolidated 
balance sheets as of January 31, 2021.
One-time transition tax. As outlined in Note 17. Income Taxes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, U.S. tax reform 
imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to 
U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The table below outlines the 
expected payments due by fiscal year.
Deferred consideration. The amounts listed for deferred consideration in the table below represent expected future 
cash payments for certain continuing MIRROR employees, subject to the continued employment of those individuals up to 
three years from the acquisition date as outlined in Note 6. Acquisition included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements due by fiscal year as of January 31, 2021, and the timing 
and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of 
January 31, 2021, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $2.8 million had been issued, including $2.4 million under 
our committed revolving credit facility.
We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity 
unconsolidated with us is a party and under which we have (i) any obligation under a guarantee, (ii) any retained or 
contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to 
such entity, (iii) any obligation under derivative instruments that are indexed to our shares and classified as equity in our 
consolidated balance sheets, or (iv) any obligation arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides 
financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services 
with us.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, 
requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial 
statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on 
assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that 
reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could 
materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 
Our critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgements are as follows, and see Note 2. Summary of Significant 
Account Policies included in Item 8 of Part II for additional information:
Inventory provisions
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make a 
provision for obsolescence and goods that have quality issues or that are damaged. We record a provision at an amount that 
is equal to the difference between the inventory cost and its net realizable value. As at January 31, 2021 the net carrying value 
of our inventories was $647.2 million, which included provisions for obsolete and damaged inventory of $30.0 million. The 
provision is determined based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market 
conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below 
our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.
Goodwill impairment assessment
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter each fiscal year, or more frequently if 
there are indicators of impairment. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit which is expected to receive the benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. 
The Company has allocated $362.5 million of goodwill to the MIRROR reporting unit. As at November 2, 2020, we 
performed a qualitative assessment and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the MIRROR 
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and therefore, no further impairment testing was required. 
In concluding that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the MIRROR reporting unit exceeded its fair value we 
considered if there had been any negative changes to the key valuation inputs; including future revenue growth rates, future 
gross and operating margin, discount rates, and terminal value assumptions since the date of acquisition. 
In future periods a full impairment test may be required depending on changes to market conditions, performance of 
the MIRROR reporting unit, or changes in the Company's strategy.
Deferred taxes on undistributed net investment of foreign subsidiaries. 
We have not recognized U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the net investment in our subsidiaries 
which we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. This determination is based on the cash flow projections and 
operational and fiscal objectives of each of our foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many 
assumptions utilized in the projections are subject to revision in the future. 
For the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that are not indefinitely reinvested, we have 
recorded a deferred tax liability for the taxes which would be due upon repatriation. For distributions made by our Canadian 
subsidiaries, the amount of tax payable is partially dependent on how the repatriation transactions are made. The deferred 
tax liability has been recorded on the basis that we would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax 
efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such 
distributions would be characterized for Canadian tax purposes as a return of capital, rather than as a dividend, and would not 
be subject to Canadian withholding tax.
As of January 31, 2021, the paid-up-capital balance of the Canadian subsidiaries for tax purposes was $2.0 billion. The 
net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries was $1.8 billion, of which $0.8 billion was determined to be indefinitely 
reinvested. The Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital such that we could choose to repatriate the portion of 
our net investment that is not indefinitely reinvested without paying Canadian withholding tax. 
Deferred income tax liabilities of $3.0 million have been recognized in relation to the portion of our net investment in 
our Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, principally representing the U.S. state income taxes which would 
34

be due upon repatriation. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested amount is approximately $2.4 
million.
In future periods, if the net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries exceeds their paid-up-capital balance, whether due 
to a change in the amount that is indefinitely reinvested or as a result of accumulation of profits by these subsidiaries, we will 
record additional deferred tax liabilities for Canadian withholding taxes and our effective tax rate will increase.
Contingencies
We are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other 
matters. We record contingent liabilities, when a loss is assessed to be probable and its amount is reasonably estimable. If it is 
reasonably possible that a material loss could occur through ongoing litigation, we provide disclosure in the footnotes to our 
financial statements. Assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of probable losses requires analysis of multiple 
factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Should we 
experience adverse court judgments or should negotiated outcomes differ to our expectations with respect to such ongoing 
litigation it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local 
currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, 
and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the 
value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange 
differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign 
currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.
We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our 
subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and 
inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we 
have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of 
currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.
As of January 31, 2021, we had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in order to hedge a portion of the 
foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. We also had certain forward 
currency contracts outstanding in an effort to reduce our exposure to the foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses that 
are recognized by our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Please 
refer to Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information, including 
details of the notional amounts outstanding.
In the future, in an effort to reduce foreign exchange risks, we may enter into further derivative financial instruments 
including hedging additional currency pairs. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative 
securities for profit.
We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. 
We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial 
statements is the U.S. dollar. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:
•
the following impacts to the consolidated statements of operations:
–
an increase in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. 
dollars for the purposes of consolidation;
–
an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations upon 
translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;
–
foreign exchange revaluation losses by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary 
assets and liabilities; and
–
derivative valuation gains on forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship;
•
the following impacts to the consolidated balance sheets:
35

–
an increase in the foreign currency translation adjustment which arises on the translation of our Canadian 
subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars; and
–
a decrease in the foreign currency translation adjustment from derivative valuation losses on forward 
currency contracts, entered into as net investment hedges of a Canadian subsidiary.
During 2020, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $57.0 million 
reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During 2019, the change in the relative value 
of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $4.6 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
within stockholders' equity.
A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rates in 
effect for 2020 would have resulted in lower income from operations of approximately $22.0 million in 2020. This assumes a 
consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar throughout the fiscal year. The timing of changes in 
the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the 
impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on our income from operations.
Interest Rate Risk. Our committed revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to 
$400.0 million. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks 
relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 31, 2021, aside from letters of 
credit of $2.4 million, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. We currently do not engage in any 
interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful 
outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times 
enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward 
contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading 
derivative securities for profit.
Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in the form of cash on hand, bank balances, short-term deposits and 
treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less, and in money market funds. We do not believe these balances 
are subject to material interest rate risk.
Credit Risk. We have cash on deposit with various large, reputable financial institutions and have invested in U.S. and 
Canadian Treasury Bills, and in AAA-rated money market funds. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain 
financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. We are also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of 
nonperformance by the financial institutions that are counterparties to our forward currency contracts. The credit risk 
amount is our unrealized gains on our derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. 
We have not experienced any losses related to these items, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. We seek to minimize our 
credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit 
standing of the financial institutions with whom we transact. We seek to limit the amount of exposure with any one 
counterparty.
Inflation
Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating 
results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross 
margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do 
not increase with these increased costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of lululemon athletica inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of lululemon athletica inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the 
Company) as of January 31, 2021 and February 2, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations and 
comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the 52-week period ended January 31, 2021, the 52-week 
period ended February 2, 2020, and the 53-week period ended February 3, 2019, including the related notes, listed in the 
index appearing under item 15(a)(1) and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) 
(collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over 
financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and February 2, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash 
flows for the 52-week period ended January 31, 2021, the 52-week period ended February 2, 2020, and the 53-week period 
ended February 3, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in 
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 
31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts 
for leases as of February 4, 2019. 
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial 
reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of 
the Company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public 
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to 
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained 
in all material respects. 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our 
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
38

necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated 
financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to 
accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, 
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, 
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
Inventory provision
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net 
realizable value, and management records a provision as necessary to appropriately value inventories that are obsolete, have 
quality issues, or are damaged. Provision expense is recorded in cost of goods sold. As of January 31, 2021, the Company’s 
consolidated net inventories balance was $647.2 million inclusive of the inventory provision of $31.0 million. The amount of 
the inventory provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value 
based on assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the inventory provision is a 
critical audit matter are (i) management identified the matter as a critical accounting estimate; and (ii) significant judgment 
was required by management in determining the estimated net realizable value of inventories that are obsolete, have quality 
issues, or are damaged, which in turn led to significant audit effort and a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating audit 
evidence relating to the estimate.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our 
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls 
relating to the review of the provision including the assumptions used. These procedures also included, among others, (i) 
observing the physical condition of inventories during inventory counts; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s 
process for developing the estimates of net realizable value; (iii) testing the reliability of reports used by management by 
agreeing to underlying records; (iv) testing the reasonableness of the assumptions about quality, damages, future demand, 
selling prices and market conditions by considering historical trends and consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of 
the audit; and corroborating the assumptions with individuals within the product team.
Acquisition of MIRROR – valuation of intangible assets
As described in Notes 1, 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of 
Curiouser Products Inc., dba MIRROR, ("MIRROR") for net consideration of $452.6 million in 2020 which resulted in $85.0 
million of intangible assets being recorded. The fair values of intangible assets were based upon valuation techniques 
including discounted cash flows, relief from royalty, and replacement cost methods. Management applied judgment in 
estimating the fair values of intangible assets acquired, which involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with 
respect to future revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and the discount rate. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of intangible 
assets in the acquisition of MIRROR – is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in 
applying procedures relating to the fair value measurements of intangible assets acquired due to the judgment by 
management when estimating the fair values of the intangible assets; (ii) significant audit effort in evaluating the significant 
assumptions relating to the intangible assets, such as the future revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and the discount rate; 
and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
39

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our 
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls 
relating to the valuation of intangible assets, including controls over management’s development of the future revenue 
growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rate assumptions utilized in the valuation of the intangible assets. These procedures 
also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement and (ii) testing management’s process for estimating the fair 
values of intangible assets. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods, 
testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant 
assumptions related to the future revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rate assumptions for the intangible assets. 
Evaluating the reasonableness of the future revenue growth rates involved considering the past performance of the acquired 
business, as well as economic and industry forecasts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in 
the evaluation of the royalty rates and discount rate assumptions.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Nature of operations
lululemon athletica inc., a Delaware corporation, ("lululemon" and, together with its subsidiaries unless the context 
otherwise requires, the "Company") is engaged in the design, distribution, and retail of healthy lifestyle inspired athletic 
apparel and accessories, which are sold through a chain of company-operated stores, direct to consumer through e-
commerce, outlets, sales from temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, license and supply arrangements, and 
warehouse sales. The Company operates stores in the United States, Canada, the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), 
Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, France, Malaysia, Sweden, Ireland, the 
Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. There were 521, 491, and 440 company-operated stores in operation as of January 31, 
2021, February 2, 2020, and February 3, 2019, respectively.
On July 7, 2020, the Company acquired Curiouser Products Inc., dba MIRROR, ("MIRROR") which has been consolidated from 
the date of acquisition. MIRROR generates net revenue from the sale of in-home fitness equipment and associated content 
subscriptions. Please refer to Note 6. Acquisition for further information.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health 
Organization in March 2020 and it has caused governments and public health officials to impose restrictions and to 
recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus. 
In February 2020, the Company temporarily closed all of its retail locations in Mainland China, and in March 2020, the 
Company temporarily closed all of its retail locations in North America, Europe, and certain countries in Asia Pacific. The 
stores in Mainland China reopened during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and stores in other markets began reopening in 
accordance with local government and public health authority guidelines during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Almost all 
of the Company's retail locations were open during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and while most retail locations have 
remained open, certain locations have temporarily closed based on government and health authority guidance in those 
markets.
The Company's distribution centers and most of its open retail locations are operating with restrictive and 
precautionary measures in place such as reduced operating hours, physical distancing, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, and 
limited occupancy levels.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various government programs have been announced which provide financial 
relief for affected businesses. The most significant relief measures which the Company qualified for are the Employee 
Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") in the United States, and the 
Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ("CEWS") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. During fiscal 2020 the 
Company recognized payroll subsidies totaling $37.1 million under these wage subsidy programs and similar plans in other 
jurisdictions. These subsidies were recorded as a reduction in the associated wage costs which the Company incurred, and 
were recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance in April 2020 in relation to accounting for lease 
concessions made in connection with the effects of COVID-19. In accordance with this guidance, the Company has elected to 
treat COVID-19-related lease concessions as variable lease payments. The Company is actively negotiating commercially 
reasonable lease concessions. Lease concessions of $9.1 million were recognized during fiscal 2020. 
Temporary closures as a result of COVID-19 and associated reduction in operating income during the first two quarters 
of fiscal 2020 were considered to be an indicator of impairment and the Company performed an assessment of recoverability 
for the long-lived assets and right-of-use assets associated with closed retail locations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the 
Company recognized an insignificant impairment charge as a result of this analysis. 
Revenue is presented net of an allowance for expected returns. The increase in the sales return allowance reflects the 
higher proportion of direct to consumer net revenue, and the longer period of time taken for returns to be made as a result of 
restricted capacity at retail locations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted the Company's operations. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to 
impact the Company's operations, and in turn, its operating results and financial position will depend on future developments, 
which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of 
COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact. Continued proliferation of the virus, or resurgence, may result 
in further or prolonged closures of the Company's retail locations and distribution centers, reduce operating hours, interrupt 
the Company's supply chain, cause changes in guest behavior, and reduce discretionary spending. Such factors could result in 
the impairment of long-lived assets and right-of-use assets and the need for an increased provision against the carrying value 
of the Company's inventories.
Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been presented in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with United 
States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
The Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-
week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 
each 52-week years. Fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year. Fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 ended on January 31, 2021, February 2, 
2020, and February 3, 2019, respectively, and are referred to as "2020," "2019," and "2018," respectively.
The Company's business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail apparel businesses. 
Historically, the Company has recognized a significant portion of its operating profit in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year as 
a result of increased net revenue during the holiday season.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lululemon athletica inc. and its wholly-owned 
subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, bank balances, and short-term deposits with original maturities of 
three months or less. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these balances, and management believes the 
Company's credit risk to be minimal.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable primarily arise out of duty receivables, sales to wholesale accounts, and license and supply 
arrangements. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management's best estimate of probable credit losses in 
accounts receivable. Receivables are written off against the allowance when management believes that the amount 
receivable will not be recovered. As of January 31, 2021, February 2, 2020, and February 3, 2019, the Company recorded an 
insignificant allowance for doubtful accounts.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of finished goods, inventories in transit, and raw materials, are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realizable value. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs, and includes all costs incurred to deliver inventory to 
the Company's distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty, and other landing costs.
The Company periodically reviews its inventories and makes a provision as necessary to appropriately value goods that 
are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of 
the inventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling 
prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of its 
inventory below its previous estimate, the Company would increase its reserve in the period in which it made such a 
determination.
In addition, the Company provides for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventory 
counts. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. The Company performs 
physical inventory counts and cycle counts throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly. 
Business combinations
48

The purchase price of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred 
including the acquisition-date fair value of the Company's previously held equity interests. The purchase price is allocated to 
the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess recorded as goodwill. 
These fair value determinations require judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The 
purchase price allocation may be provisional during a measurement period of up to one year to provide reasonable time to 
obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any such measurement 
period adjustments are recognized in the period in which the adjustment amount is determined. Transaction costs associated 
with the acquisition are expensed as incurred. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the fair value of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree, and the acquisition-date fair value of the Company's previously held equity interest over the net 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit which is expected to receive the benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill 
might be impaired. Generally, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely 
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If factors indicate that this is the case, the 
Company then estimates the fair value of the related reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the 
goodwill of the reporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an impairment equal to the excess of 
the carrying value over its fair value.
Intangible assets
Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and are 
reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the asset group to which the intangible assets belong 
might be impaired. The Company revises the estimated remaining useful life of these assets when events or changes in 
circumstances warrant a revision. If the Company revises the useful life, the unamortized balance is amortized over the 
remaining useful life on a prospective basis.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Direct internal and external costs related 
to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add 
functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation commences when an asset is ready for its intended use. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the expected useful life of the asset, which is individually assessed, and estimated to be up to 20 years. Leasehold 
improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease and the estimated useful life 
of the improvement, to a maximum of 10 years for stores and 15 years for corporate offices and distribution centers. All other 
property and equipment are depreciated using the declining balance method as follows:
Furniture and fixtures
20%
Computer hardware and software
20% - 50%
Equipment and vehicles
30%
Cloud Computing Arrangements
Costs incurred to implement cloud computing service arrangements are initially deferred, and recognized as other non-
current assets. Implementation costs are subsequently amortized over the expected term of the related cloud service. The 
carrying value of cloud computing implementation costs are tested for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates 
that the asset might be impaired. Changes in cloud computing arrangement implementation costs are classified within 
operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Impairment of long-lived assets
Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, held for use are evaluated for impairment when the 
occurrence of events or a change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as 
measured by comparing their carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use and 
eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by discounting the future cash flows 
expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are 
recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined.
49

Leased property and equipment
At lease commencement, which is generally when the Company takes possession of the asset, the Company records a 
lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset. Lease liabilities represent the present value of minimum lease payments 
over the expected lease term, which includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain those 
options will be exercised. The present value of the lease liability is determined using the Company's incremental collateralized 
borrowing rate at the lease commencement. 
Minimum lease payments include base rent, fixed escalation of rental payments, and rental payments that are adjusted 
periodically depending on a rate or index. In determining minimum lease payments, the Company does not separate non-
lease components for real estate leases. Non-lease components are generally services that the lessor performs for the 
Company associated with the leased asset, such as common area maintenance. 
Right-of-use assets represent the right to control the use of the leased asset during the lease and are initially recognized 
in an amount equal to the lease liability. In addition, prepaid rent, initial direct costs, and adjustments for lease incentives are 
components of the right-of-use asset. Over the lease term the lease expense is amortized on a straight-line basis beginning on 
the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment as part of the impairment of long-lived 
assets, which is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or 
asset group may not be recoverable.
Variable lease payments, including contingent rental payments based on sales volume, are recognized when the 
achievement of the specific target is probable. A right-of-use asset and lease liability are not recognized for leases with an 
initial term of 12 months or less, and the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of asset retirement obligations ("AROs") when such obligations are 
incurred. The Company's AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease, the 
Company is contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with 
such conditions, the Company records an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated 
fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management's judgment, 
including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. 
The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction 
of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is 
recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company recognizes a liability for a cost associated with a lease exit or disposal activity when such obligation is 
incurred. A lease exit or disposal liability is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. The 
Company estimates fair value at the cease-use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals, reduced by 
estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, even where the Company does not intend to 
enter into a sublease. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it 
would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs 
could be significantly affected if future experience differs from the assumptions used in the initial estimate. 
Revenue recognition
Net revenue is comprised of company-operated store net revenue, direct to consumer net revenue through websites 
and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via the Company's distribution 
centers, and other net revenue, which includes revenue from MIRROR, outlets, temporary locations, sales to wholesale 
accounts, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of the 
Company's products to licensees. All revenue is reported net of markdowns, discounts, sales taxes collected from customers 
on behalf of taxing authorities, and returns.
MIRROR generates net revenue from the sale of in-home fitness equipment and associated content subscriptions. 
Certain in-home fitness contracts contain multiple performance obligations, including hardware and a subscription service 
commitment. For customer contracts that contain multiple performance obligations the Company accounts for individual 
performance obligations if they are distinct. The transaction price, net of discounts, is allocated to each performance 
obligation based on its standalone selling price.
Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods to 
the Company's customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of 
the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of 
ownership, and customer acceptance. Revenue from company-operated stores and other retail locations is recognized at the 
point of sale. Direct to consumer revenue, sales to wholesale accounts and in-home fitness hardware sales are recognized 
50

upon receipt by the customer. In certain arrangements the Company receives payment before the customer receives the 
promised good. These payments are initially recorded as deferred revenue, and recognized as revenue in the period when 
control is transferred to the customer.
Revenue is presented net of an allowance for estimated returns. The Company's liability for sales return refunds is 
recognized within other current liabilities, and an asset for the value of inventory which is expected to be returned is 
recognized within other prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Shipping fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue, and shipping costs are recognized within selling, general and 
administrative expenses in the same period the related revenue is recognized.
Proceeds from the sale of gift cards are initially deferred and recognized within unredeemed gift card liability on the 
consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when tendered for payment. While the Company will continue to 
honor all gift cards presented for payment, to the extent management determines there is no requirement to remit unused 
card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, the portion of card balances not expected to be 
redeemed are recognized in net revenue in proportion to the gift cards which have been redeemed, under the redemption 
recognition method. For 2020, 2019, and 2018, net revenue recognized on unredeemed gift card balances was $13.7 million, 
$11.9 million, and $6.9 million, respectively.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold includes:
•
the cost of purchased merchandise, which includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and 
labor, as applicable;
•
the cost incurred to deliver inventory to the Company's distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, 
duty, and other landing costs;
•
the cost of the Company's distribution centers, such as labor, rent, utilities, and depreciation;
•
the cost of the Company's production, design, research and development, distribution, and merchandising 
departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and other expenses;
•
occupancy costs such as minimum rent, contingent rent where applicable, property taxes, utilities, and depreciation 
expense for the Company's company-operated store locations;
•
hemming costs;
•
shrink and inventory provision expense; and
•
the cost of digital content subscription services, including the costs of content creation, studio overhead, and 
related production departments.
Selling, general and administrative expenses 
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold, 
intangible asset amortization, or acquisition-related expenses. The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses 
include the costs of corporate and retail employee wages and benefits, costs to transport the Company's products from the 
distribution facilities to the Company's retail locations and e-commerce guests, professional fees, marketing, information 
technology, human resources, accounting, legal, corporate facility and occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization 
expense other than in cost of goods sold.
For 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company incurred costs to transport its products from its distribution facilities to its retail 
locations and e-commerce guests of $232.4 million, $106.7 million, and $79.5 million, respectively. 
Store pre-opening costs
Operating costs incurred prior to the opening of new stores are expensed as incurred as selling, general and 
administrative expenses.
Income taxes
The Company follows the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities, and for tax losses, tax credit carryforwards, and other tax attributes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
51

measured using enacted tax rates, for the appropriate tax jurisdiction, that are expected to be in effect when these 
differences are anticipated to reverse.
The Company has not recognized U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign 
subsidiaries which the Company has determined to be indefinitely reinvested. 
Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is 
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The evaluation as to the likelihood 
of realizing the benefit of a deferred income tax asset is based on the timing of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, 
taxable income forecasts, and tax-planning strategies. The recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several 
assumptions and forecasts, including current and anticipated taxable income, the utilization of previously unrealized non-
operating loss carryforwards, and regulatory reviews of tax filings. 
The Company evaluates its tax filing positions and recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is considered more 
likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the 
position. This determination requires the use of significant judgment. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which an 
uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, facts or circumstances change, tax laws change, 
or new information becomes available. The Company's policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income 
tax matters as part of other income (expense), net. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability 
on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. tax reform") was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduced significant 
changes to U.S. income tax law. The Company completed the accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform during 
2018. U.S. tax reform changes and their impact to the Company are outlined in Note 17. Income Taxes. The Company treats 
the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") tax as an in period tax.
Fair value of financial instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are made using a three-tier fair 
value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value: 
•
Level 1 - defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
•
Level 2 - defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly 
observable; and 
•
Level 3 - defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to 
develop its own assumptions.
The fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety by reference to its lowest level of significant input.
The Company records cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities at cost. The carrying values of 
these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's 
opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.
The Company holds certain assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, 
which are outlined in Note 14. Fair Value Measurement.
Foreign currency
The functional currency for each entity included in these consolidated financial statements that is domiciled outside of 
the United States is generally the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities of each foreign entity are translated into 
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Net revenue and expenses are translated at the average 
rate in effect during the period. Unrealized translation gains and losses are recorded as a foreign currency translation 
adjustment, which is included in other comprehensive income or loss, which is a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive income or loss included in stockholders' equity.
Foreign currency transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency are remeasured into 
the functional currency with any resulting gains and losses recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses, except 
for gains and losses arising on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature, which 
are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income or loss.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. 
52

Net investment hedges. The Company enters into certain forward currency contracts that are designated as net 
investment hedges. The effective portions of the hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, 
net of tax, and will subsequently be reclassified to net earnings in the period in which the hedged investment is either sold or 
substantially liquidated. Hedge effectiveness is measured using a method based on changes in forward exchange rates. The 
Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within investing activities in the consolidated 
statements of cash flows. 
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The Company also enters into certain forward currency contracts 
that are not designated as net investment hedges. They are designed to economically hedge the foreign exchange revaluation 
gains and losses of certain monetary assets and liabilities. The Company has not applied hedge accounting to these 
instruments and the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. 
The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its forward currency contracts which are not designated in hedging 
relationships within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values within prepaid expenses 
and other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. However, the Company's Master 
International Swap Dealers Association, Inc., Agreements and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain 
conditions. 
The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Additional information on the 
Company's derivative financial instruments is included in Note 14. Fair Value Measurement and Note 15. Derivative Financial 
Instruments.
Concentration of credit risk
Accounts receivable are primarily from inventory duty receivables, wholesale accounts, and from license and supply 
arrangements. The Company generally does not require collateral to support the accounts receivable; however, in certain 
circumstances, the Company may require parties to provide payment for goods prior to delivery of the goods or to provide 
letters of credit. The accounts receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is established based on 
management's assessment of the credit risk of the underlying accounts.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with high quality financial institutions. The amount of cash and cash equivalents 
held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. The Company is also exposed to credit-related 
losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is the 
Company's unrealized gains on its derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. The 
Company has not experienced any losses related to these items, and it believes credit risk to be minimal. The Company seeks 
to minimize its credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by 
monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom it transacts. It seeks to limit the amount of exposure 
with any one counterparty. 
The Company's derivative contracts contain certain credit risk-related contingent features. Under certain circumstances, 
including an event of default, bankruptcy, termination, and cross default under the Company's North American revolving 
credit facility, the Company may be required to make immediate payment for outstanding liabilities under its derivative 
contracts.
Stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is 
estimated at the date of grant. Awards settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to 
fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. The employee compensation expense is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital for awards that are 
settled in common shares, and with the offsetting credit to accrued compensation and related expenses for awards that are 
settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee. 
For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on 
the number of awards expected to vest, reflecting estimated expected forfeitures, and is adjusted to reflect those awards that 
do ultimately vest. For awards with performance conditions, the Company recognizes the compensation expense if and when 
the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The Company reassesses the 
probability of achieving the performance condition at each reporting date. 
The grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the award date using the Black-Scholes model, 
and the grant date fair value of restricted shares, performance-based restricted stock units, and restricted stock units is based 
on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the award date. Restricted stock units that are settled in cash or 
common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until 
53

settlement. This fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last business day before each 
period end.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common and exchangeable shares outstanding 
during the period. Exchangeable shares are the equivalent of common shares in all material respects. All classes of stock have 
in effect the same rights and share equally in undistributed net income. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing 
net income available to stockholders for the period by the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the 
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution from common shares issuable through stock options, 
performance-based restricted stock units that have satisfied their performance factor, restricted shares, and restricted stock 
units using the treasury stock method.
Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment 
relationships and a variety of other matters. The Company records contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when 
a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standard Updates ("ASUs"). ASUs adopted during 
2020 were assessed, and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on its consolidated 
financial position or results of operations.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842") to increase 
transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and 
disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a lease 
liability, which represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-
use asset on the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASC 842 on February 4, 2019 using the modified retrospective 
approach with no restatement of comparative periods.
The Company has chosen to apply the transition package of three practical expedients which allow companies not to 
reassess whether agreements contain leases, the classification of leases, and the capitalization of initial direct costs. The 
Company did not elect the practical expedient to use hindsight when determining the lease term.
The primary financial statement impact upon adoption was the recognition, on a discounted basis, of the Company's 
minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases as right-of-use assets and obligations on the consolidated balance 
sheets. As of February 4, 2019, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were $619.6 million and $651.1 million, respectively. 
Pre-existing lease balances of $34.8 million from current assets, $9.3 million from non-current assets, and $75.5 million from 
non-current liabilities were reclassified to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as part of the adoption of the new standard. 
There was no cumulative earnings effect adjustment on transition.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
ASUs recently issued not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have 
minimal impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance on ASC 740, Income Taxes. The amendments in this update simplify the 
accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740. The amendments also 
improve consistent application and simplify GAAP for other areas of this topic by clarifying and amending existing guidance. 
This Company is evaluating the impact of this update.

NOTE 6. ACQUISITION
On July 7, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of MIRROR, an in-home fitness company with an 
interactive workout platform that features live and on-demand classes. The results of operations, financial position, and cash 
flows of MIRROR have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred at the date of acquisition, as well as the 
calculation of goodwill based on the excess of consideration over the provisional fair value of net assets acquired. As part of 
the transaction, the Company assumed $30.1 million of MIRROR's outstanding debt. This included $15.1 million of external 
debt that was settled as part of the transaction and $15.0 million of debt previously owed by MIRROR to the Company, which 
55

represents the effective settlement of a preexisting relationship. The debt was determined to be at market terms and was 
recognized as a component of the consideration transferred, and no gain or loss was recorded on settlement.

Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions to derive the fair value of acquired assets 
and liabilities, and in the case of MIRROR, this is with specific reference to acquired intangible assets. The fair value of 
intangible assets was based upon widely-accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and relief from 
royalty and replacement cost methods, depending on the nature of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed. Inherent in each 
valuation technique are critical assumptions, including future revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and the discount rate. The 
recognition of deferred tax assets in relation to the historic net operating losses of MIRROR relied on assumptions and 
estimates of the future profitability of the Company's U.S. operations.
The Company has not disclosed pro forma information of the combined business as the transaction is not material to 
revenue or net earnings.
Acquisition-related expenses
In connection with the acquisition, the Company recognized certain acquisition-related expenses which are expensed as 
incurred. These expenses are recognized within acquisition-related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
include the following amounts:
•
transaction and integration costs, including fees for advisory and professional services incurred as part of the 
acquisition and integration costs subsequent to the acquisition;
•
acquisition-related compensation, including the partial acceleration of vesting of certain stock options, and amounts 
due to selling shareholders that are contingent upon continuing employment; and
•
gain recognized on the Company's existing investment in the acquiree as of the acquisition date.

The Company will recognize a total expense of $57.1 million for deferred consideration which is due to certain 
continuing MIRROR employees, subject to the continued employment of those individuals through various vesting dates up to 
three years from the acquisition date. This acquisition-related compensation is expensed over the vesting periods as service is 
provided, and consists of cash payments, which are included within accrued compensation and related expenses until 
payments are made, and stock-based compensation awards that have been granted under the Company's 2014 Equity 
Incentive Plan to replace certain unvested options as of the acquisition date.

major financial institutions. During 2018, the Company amended the credit agreement to provide for: 
i.
an increase in the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility to $400.0 million, with an increase of 
the sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit and extensions of swing line loans to $50.0 million for each; 
ii.
an increase in the option, subject to certain conditions, to request increases in commitments from $400.0 million to 
$600.0 million; and

may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, and in other currencies, subject to the lenders' approval. 
As of January 31, 2021, aside from letters of credit of $2.4 million, there were no other borrowings outstanding under 
this facility.
Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (a) based on the rates 
applicable for deposits on the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the borrowings are made 
("LIBOR") or (b) an alternate base rate, plus, an applicable margin determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the 
ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and rent ("EBITDAR") and ranges between 
1.00%-1.50% for LIBOR loans and 0.00%-0.50% for alternate base rate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 
0.10%-0.20% is payable on the average unused amounts under the revolving credit facility, and fees of 1.00%-1.50% are 
payable on unused letters of credit.
The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the 
ability of the Company's subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all 
or substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and 
distributions.
The Company is also required to maintain a consolidated rent-adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5:1 and to 
maintain the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) below 2:1. The credit agreement also 
contains certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among 
others, an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). As of January 31, 2021, the Company was in 
compliance with the covenants of the credit facility.

NOTE 13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS
Stock-based compensation plans
The Company's eligible employees participate in various stock-based compensation plans, provided directly by the 
Company.
In June 2014, the Company's stockholders approved the adoption of the lululemon athletica inc. 2014 Equity Incentive 
Plan ("2014 Plan"). The 2014 Plan provides for awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock 
purchase rights, restricted share bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance-based restricted stock 
units, cash-based awards, other stock-based awards, and deferred compensation awards to employees (including officers and 
directors who are also employees), consultants, and directors of the Company.
The awards granted under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan ("2007 Plan") remain outstanding and continue to vest under 
their original conditions. No further awards will be granted under the 2007 Plan.
The Company has granted stock options, performance-based restricted stock units, restricted stock units, and restricted 
shares. Stock options granted to date generally have a four-year vesting period and vest at a rate of 25% each year on the 
anniversary date of the grant. Stock options generally expire on the earlier of seven years from the date of grant, or a 
specified period of time following termination. Performance-based restricted stock units issued generally vest three years 
from the grant date and restricted shares generally vest one year from the grant date. Restricted stock units granted generally 
have a three-year vesting period and vest at a certain percentage each year on the anniversary date of the grant.
The Company issues previously unissued shares upon the exercise of Company options, vesting of performance-based 
restricted stock units or restricted stock units that are settled in common stock, and granting of restricted shares.
Stock-based compensation expense charged to income for the plans was $56.6 million, $46.1 million, and $29.6 million 
for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Total unrecognized compensation cost for all stock-based compensation plans was $75.7 million as of January 31, 2021, 
which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years, and was $63.4 million as of February 2, 2020 
over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

A total of 12.9 million shares of the Company's common stock have been authorized for future issuance under the 
Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.
The Company's performance-based restricted stock units are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to 
receive a maximum of two shares of common stock per performance-based restricted stock unit if the Company achieves 
specified performance goals and the grantee remains employed during the vesting period. The fair value of performance-
based restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the award date. Expense for 
performance-based restricted stock units is recognized when it is probable that the performance goal will be achieved.
The grant date fair value of the restricted shares and restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the 
Company's common stock on the award date. Restricted stock units that are settled in cash or common stock at the election 
of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. This fair value is based on 
the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last business day before each period end.
The grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. 
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect 
market conditions and the Company's historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon the historical 
experience of similar awards, giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based 
upon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the 
options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the period corresponding with the expected 
term of the options. The following are weighted averages of the assumptions that were used in calculating the fair value of 
stock options granted in 2020, 2019, and 2018:

The Company has short-term, highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents, which are invested in money 
market funds, Treasury bills, and term deposits. The Company records cash equivalents at their original purchase prices plus 
interest that has accrued at the stated rate.
The fair values of the forward currency contract assets and liabilities are determined using observable Level 2 inputs, 
including foreign currency spot exchange rates, forward pricing curves, and interest rates. The fair values consider the credit 
risk of the Company and its counterparties. The Company's Master International Swap Dealers Association, Inc., Agreements 
and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions. However, the Company records all derivatives 
on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value and does not offset derivative assets and liabilities.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis
The Company has also recorded lease termination liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis, determined using 
Level 3 inputs based on remaining lease rentals and reduced by estimated sublease income. 
NOTE 15. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company currently hedges against changes in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate and changes in the 
Chinese Yuan to U.S. dollar exchange rate using forward currency contracts.
Net investment hedges
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange gains and losses which arise on translation of its foreign subsidiaries' 
balance sheets into U.S. dollars. These gains and losses are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in 
accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.
The Company holds a significant portion of its assets in Canada and during 2020, it entered into forward currency 
contracts designed to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into 
U.S. dollars. These forward currency contracts are designated as net investment hedges. The Company assesses hedge 
effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges 
during 2020.
63

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
During 2020, the Company entered into certain forward currency contracts designed to economically hedge the foreign 
exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by its Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on U.S. dollar 
denominated monetary assets and liabilities.

NOTE 16. LEASES
The Company has obligations under operating leases for its store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, 
and equipment. As of January 31, 2021, the lease terms of the various leases range from two to fifteen years. The majority of 
the Company's leases include renewal options at the sole discretion of the Company. In general, it is not reasonably certain 
64

that lease renewals will be exercised at lease commencement and therefore lease renewals are not included in the lease 
term.
The following table details the Company's net lease expense. Certain of the Company's leases include rent escalation 
clauses, rent holidays, and leasehold rental incentives. The majority of the Company's leases for store premises also include 
contingent rental payments based on sales volume. The variable lease expenses disclosed below include contingent rent 
payments and other non-fixed lease related costs, including common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's 
insurance.

U.S. tax reform
The U.S. tax reforms enacted in December 2017 introduced significant changes to the U.S. income tax laws, including 
reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a shift to a territorial tax system which changed how foreign 
earnings are subject to U.S. tax, and the imposition of a mandatory one-time transition tax on the accumulated undistributed 
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. 
66

One-time transition tax. U.S. tax reform required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign 
subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% on cash and cash equivalents and 8% on the 
remaining earnings, net of foreign tax credits. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years. 
As a result of completing its fiscal 2017 U.S. tax returns and incorporating newly issued guidance into its calculations the 
Company recognized an additional current tax expense of $7.5 million during 2018 for the mandatory one-time transition tax. 
The Company completed the accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform in 2018. 
Tax on repatriation from foreign subsidiaries 
U.S. tax reform and the shift to a territorial tax system in fiscal 2017 eliminated U.S. federal income taxes upon the 
repatriation of foreign earnings. However, U.S. tax reform did not eliminate foreign withholding taxes, or certain state income 
taxes. 
During 2018, the Company completed its evaluation of the impact that U.S. tax reform has upon repatriation taxes, its 
reinvestment plans, and the most efficient means of deploying its capital resources. As a result of these evaluations, the 
Company repatriated $778.9 million from a Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. parent entity in 2018. A net current tax expense of 
$23.7 million was recognized in 2018 on this distribution. 
As of January 31, 2021, the Company's net investment in its Canadian subsidiaries was $1.8 billion, of which $0.8 billion 
was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. A deferred income tax liability of $3.0 million has been recognized in relation to 
the portion of the Company's net investment in its Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, principally 
representing the U.S. state income taxes which would be due upon repatriation. This deferred tax liability has been recorded 
on the basis that the Company would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. 
Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be 
characterized as a return of capital for Canadian tax purposes, and therefore not subject to Canadian withholding tax. The 
unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested amount is approximately $2.4 million.
No deferred income tax liabilities have been recognized on any of the undistributed earnings of the Company's other 
foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States. Excluding its Canadian 
subsidiaries, cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries as of January 31, 2021 were $89.7 
million.
As of January 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $508.7 million outside of the United States.

As of January 31, 2021, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $59.1 million. The majority of the net 
operating loss carryforwards expire, if unused, between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2039.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S., Canada, and various foreign, state, and provincial jurisdictions. The 
2017 to 2019 tax years remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The 2013 tax year is still 
open for certain state tax authorities. The 2013 to 2019 tax years remain subject to examination by Canadian tax authorities. 
The 2013 to 2019 tax years remain subject to examination by tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company 
does not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in 
the Company's tax returns.

The Company's calculation of weighted-average shares includes the common stock of the Company as well as the 
exchangeable shares. Exchangeable shares are the equivalent of common shares in all material respects. All classes of stock 
have in effect the same rights and share equally in undistributed net income. For 2020, 2019, and 2018, 30.8 thousand, 48.0 
thousand, and 32.2 thousand stock options and awards, respectively, were anti-dilutive to earnings per share and therefore 
have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.
On November 29, 2017, the Company's board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $200.0 
million and on June 6, 2018, the board of directors approved an increase to this stock repurchase program, authorizing the 
repurchase of up to a total of $600.0 million of the Company's common shares. These programs were completed during the 
first quarter of 2019.
On January 31, 2019, the Company's board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $500.0 million of 
the Company's common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. On December 1, 2020, the 
Company's board of directors approved an increase in the remaining authorization of the existing stock repurchase program 
from $263.6 million to $500.0 million. The repurchase plan has no time limit and does not require the repurchase of any 
minimum number of shares. Common shares repurchased on the open market are at prevailing market prices, including under 
plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing and 
actual number of common shares to be repurchased will depend upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other 
factors, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements. As of January 31, 2021, the remaining value of 
shares available to be repurchased under this program was $500.0 million.
During 2020, 2019, and 2018, 0.4 million, 1.1 million, and 4.9 million shares, respectively, were repurchased under the 
programs at a total cost of $63.7 million, $173.4 million, and $598.3 million, respectively.
Subsequent to January 31, 2021, and up to March 24, 2021, no shares were repurchased.
NOTE 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

cash payments for certain continuing MIRROR employees, subject to the continued employment of those individuals up to 
three years from the acquisition date as outlined in Note 6. Acquisition.
One-time transition tax. As outlined in Note 17. Income Taxes, U.S. tax reform imposed a mandatory transition tax on 
accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition 
tax is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. The one-time transition tax payable is net of foreign tax credits, and the 
table above outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.
Contingencies
Legal proceedings. In addition to the legal proceedings described below, the Company is, from time to time, involved in 
routine legal matters, and audits and inspections by governmental agencies and other third parties which are incidental to the 
conduct of its business. This includes legal matters such as initiation and defense of proceedings to protect intellectual 
property rights, personal injury claims, product liability claims, employment claims, and similar matters. The Company 
believes the ultimate resolution of any such legal proceedings, audits, and inspections will not have a material adverse effect 
on its consolidated balance sheets, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recognized immaterial provisions 
related to the expected outcome of legal proceedings.
In March 2020, a former retail employee filed a representative action in the Los Angeles Superior Court alleging 
violation of the Private Attorney General Act ("PAGA") based on purported California labor code violations including failure to 
pay wages, failure to pay overtime, failure to provide accurate itemized statements, and failure to provide meal and rest 
periods. The plaintiff is seeking to recover civil penalties under PAGA. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter.
In April 2020, Aliign Activation Wear, LLC filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of 
California alleging federal trademark infringement, false designation of origin and unfair competition. The plaintiff is seeking 
injunctive relief, monetary damages and declaratory relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and 
principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our 
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report, or the Evaluation Date. Based upon the 
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls 
and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures 
designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as 
this report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that such information is 
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and 
accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our 
assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
72

statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being 
made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements. Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and 
accounting officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, 
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the 
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource limitations on all 
control systems; no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of 
fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk 
that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as 
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management conducted an evaluation of 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on this 
evaluation, management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 
2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report in Item 8 of Part II of 
this Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020 that have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

restricted stock units, (c) 274,707 shares subject to outstanding restricted stock units, and (d) 14,926 shares subject to outstanding restricted stock

Plan have already been reflected in our total outstanding common stock balance.

issuance under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan is reduced by 1.7 shares for each award other than stock options granted and by one share for each 
stock option award granted. Outstanding awards that expire or are canceled without having been exercised or settled in full are available for issuance 
again under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and shares that are withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for full value awards are also 
again available for issuance. No further awards may be issued under the predecessor plan, our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan.

Sales revenue is found on the statement of income and represents the 
amounts charged to customers for the sale of goods and services.   
b. 
Accounts receivable appears on the statement of financial position and 
represents claims to cash, for the sale of goods and services, that have 
not yet been collected from the customer.  Accounts receivable 
represents an asset of the company. 
c. 
The connection between these two accounts is that accounts receivable 
are created when sales have been made on credit.

c.  
It is unlikely that Lydia will have an account called ‘accounts receivable’ 
since most of her sales will be on a cash basis. If customers purchased 
flowers and other items on credit, then Lydia would have accounts 
receivable on her statement of financial position that would represent the 
amount that she is owed from her customers. However, florist shops sell 
products that are relatively inexpensive, therefore most customers, if not 
all, will have enough funds to pay cash for their purchase, which is why 
it is unlikely that Lydia will have an account called “accounts receivable”.  
It may be necessary for her to have an accounts receivable account if 
she has customers that purchase frequently and/or in large quantities, 
such as an event planner.  In that case, it would be appropriate to ship 
a large order of flowers along with an invoice.  Until the invoice is paid 
(by the event planner for example), the amount owing would be 
“accounts receivable”.

UP1-2   
a. 
 The loan officer would be interested in your company’s ability to repay the 
loan and thus would look at net income and cash flows. The loan officer 
would also need to consider a backup plan in the event your company 
does not make the required loan payments. For example, which assets 
of your company could be given to the bank in lieu of repayment, or sold 
to provide cash for repayment? The loan officer would also look at your 
statement of financial position to identify the assets owned by your 
company, but would prefer up-to-date market values for these assets 
rather than the historical costs listed on the statement of financial 
position.  Any other current or non-current liabilities would be of interest 
to the loan officer, as they may indicate previous obligations that could 
compromise the ability to repay a new loan.  
 
b.   
1. Is your net income sufficient to repay a loan? 
2. Is your net income sustainable? 
3. Do you have assets that could be liquidated if your cash flows 
are insufficient? 
4. Do you have currently existing debt that will make it difficult to 
repay new loans? 
*Other answers may also be accepted.

Chapter Three  
Double-Entry Accounting and the Accounting Cycle  
 
Journal Entries 
 
Even though most of you will not be involved in accounting, knowledge 
of how transactions are recorded is valuable in understanding the effect 
of transactions on the financial statements. 
 
As you will recall, transactions must be recorded into accounts.  If the 
amount is recorded on the left side it is known as a debit.  If the 
amount is recorded on the right side of the account, it is known as a 
credit.  
  
This is one of the few times, I will ask you to memorize the 
rules of journal entries.  The rules of Debit (dr) and Credit 
(cr) are as follows:  
 
• • An increase in an asset is recorded by a debit  
• • A decrease in an asset is recorded by a credit  
• • An increase in a liability is recorded by a credit  
• • A decrease in a liability is recorded by a debit  
• • An increase in shareholders’ equity is recorded by a credit  
• • A decrease in shareholders’ equity is recorded by a debit  
• • An increase in revenue is recorded by a credit  
• • A decrease in revenue is recorded by a debit  
• • An increase in an expense is recorded by a debit  
• • A decrease in an expense is recorded by a credit  
• • A gain is recorded by a credit  
• • A loss is recorded by a debit

(Brief explanation of entry)  
 
Important items to note:  
 
• Debits are always entered first; followed by credits; note the 
indentation of the credits. 
• Entries must balance - debits must equal credits.  
• Good journal entries always include a brief explanation of the entry.  
This is especially important for more complicated entries. 
 
There is no need to add the words debit and credit beside each account 
name - I have done this for illustrative purposes only  
 
Journal entries are entered into a journal (known as the book of original 
entry) in chronological order. At the end of the month, the accountant 
will transfer the amounts shown in each entry to the relevant Account. 
This process which is done automatically by a computer program or by 
hand in a manual system is known as posting.  
 
In this course we do not focus on the actual bookkeeping but use T-
accounts to analyze the effect on various Accounts.

COMR 457 
T-Accounts 
 
A useful tool in analyzing transactions and accounts is known as a T- 
Account. Each account has two sides- the left side known as a debit 
and the right side known as a credit. Don’t think of debits and credits 
as good or bad, simply right or left!  
 
 
       Debit (Dr)  
 
    Credit (Cr) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Evaluate your transaction, prepare the journal entry, and then post your 
journal entry to the T accounts.  Remember to reference your journal 
entries by either number or letter.   
 
Normal Balances 
 
Assets, expenses and loss accounts have a normal balance of a debit 
amount, while gains, liabilities, revenue and shareholder equity 
accounts have a normal balance of a credit amount.   
 
Exhibit 3.6 on page 3-8 provides an excellent overview of the Accounting 
Cycle.  We understand that transactions are identified, recorded in a 
journal and then posted to specific accounts.  The examples on pages 
3-12 to 3-18 provide examples of how transactions are journalized.  
Again, I suggest you work through these examples. 
 
At the end of a period, the accounting department prepares itself for the 
preparation of month end or yearend financial statements.

COMR 457 
Unadjusted Trial Balance 
 
The starting point for the preparation of financial statements is the 
unadjusted trial balance – i.e., a listing of each account and its current 
balance.  A sample may be found in Exhibit 3.11 on page 3-21. 
 
At this point note that the total of the debit column must equal the total 
of the credit column.  This document is entitled “unadjusted” because 
further accounting adjustments are usually required under the accrual 
basis of accounting.  I want to reinforce that the fact the unadjusted trial 
balance does not guarantee that the accounts are complete or accurate.   
 
ADJUSTING ENTRIES 
 
We have learned that an entity needs to record all transactions. In a 
perfect world, a company would record all transactions daily and 
therefore would never need to make any adjustments at the end of an 
accounting period. However, given the volume of transactions and the 
delays encountered in practice, it would be unusual not to have to make 
some adjustments at period end. 
 
The need for timely, accurate and complete information means that 
companies require information monthly, quarterly, and annually. While 
adjustments may be required any time financial statements are 
prepared, let’s assume for this chapter that we are preparing the year 
end annual financial statements. Most companies, regardless of size, 
will have a computerized accounting package. Accountants and 
bookkeepers will have already inputted accounting transactions 
throughout the year.  
 
The starting point for the preparation of financial statements is the 
Unadjusted Trial Balance - a listing of the balances in each account of 
the chart of accounts at the end of the year. Notice the ordering of the 
listing - Assets, Liabilities, Shareholder Equity Accounts, Revenues,

COMR 457 
Gains, Expenses and Losses. In practice, I usually go through each 
account to determine whether each account is in its normal debit or 
credit balance. 
 
Remember that Assets, Expenses and Losses are usually in a debit 
balance while Liabilities, Equity accounts, Revenues and Gains are in a 
credit balance. There are exceptions - Accumulated Depreciation and 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts are in credit balances. These two 
accounts are known as contra accounts as they offset Property, Plant 
and Equipment and Accounts Receivable respectively.  
 
Management must ensure that all transactions pertaining to the 
entity have been recorded in the proper period! Only accountants 
who have a firm understanding of the business will be able to 
address this issue properly. If every transaction is recorded, then 
no further adjustments will be required. If not, which will usually be 
the case, ADJUSTING JOURNAL ENTRIES WILL BE REQUIRED.   
 
Always remember that Adjusting journal entries never involve 
cash. Transactions affecting cash should have already been recorded. 
 
The accounting department needs to review all accounts and determine 
which, if any, require adjustment.  Let’s consider the type of adjustments 
which may have to be recorded.

COMR 457 
Examples of commonly encountered adjustments 
 
REVENUE 
(In these examples the term Sales and Revenue are used 
interchangeably)  
 
 
• Revenue could be under- or overstated. 
• Revenue could be understated because the company has not yet 
recorded revenue which has been earned. This is often work 
completed or sales made in the last few days of the year. The 
adjusting journal entry to record or accrue revenue is:  
 
Dr Accounts Receivable  
Cr   
Sales/Revenue  
 
This is known as accruing (or the accrual of) revenue.  
 
• Revenue may be understated because management has not 
recognized revenue which is presently recorded in the Unearned 
or Deferred Revenue account. A company may have received 
payments in advance of supplying a service or selling a product. 
When the funds were received, they were recorded in the 
Unearned Revenue account (i.e., a liability account). During the 
year, the service was provided or goods sold but the amount was 
never transferred to the revenue account. At year end, it is 
important to adjust the Unearned Revenue account and properly 
record the revenue. The adjusting journal entry would be: 
  
Dr Unearned Revenue  
Cr   
Sales/Revenue  
 
• Revenue may be overstated. This usually arises when a company 
receives and records a payment from a customer as revenue prior 
to the sale actually being finalized or the service being provided. If

7 
COMR 457 
the sale is not completed or service is not provided prior to the year 
end, revenue will be overstated. The adjusting journal entry to 
correct this situation is: 
  
Dr Sales/Revenue  
Cr     
Unearned Revenue  
 
 
UNEARNED REVENUE 
 
Unearned or Deferred Revenue represents a liability which must be 
satisfied - i.e. the company must deliver the product or services or return 
the funds advanced by the customer. 
 
• Revenue may also be recorded prematurely- although the criteria 
of revenue recognition have not been satisfied, the company has 
been aggressive and simply recorded the amount.  This is often 
referred to as fraudulent financial reporting.  Such revenue should 
be reversed until such time as it has been earned. 
 
In order to make an adjusting journal entry you have to determine 
how the client originally recorded the transaction. Don’t memorize 
adjustments.  Try these steps to help guide you through the 
process. Determine the current balance in the account (i.e. how did the 
company initially record the transaction) and then determine what the 
ending balance should be.  The difference between what is in the 
account and what the ending balance should be will provide you with the 
information needed to create the necessary adjusting journal entry.

COMR 457 
Examples of commonly encountered adjustments continued 
 
Example 
 
A customer pays $1,000 to a company during the year. The payment represents payment for a 
product the company hopes to deliver before its year end.  
 
At year end, only $700 of the product has actually been shipped to the customer. The following 
summarizes two ways the company could have recorded the transactions and the appropriate 
adjusting journal entry: 
 
A) Client initially records the receipt of cash as revenue 
 
Dr Cash   
1,000  
Cr  Revenue   
 
1,000  
 
At year end since only $700 of product has been sold, an adjusting journal entry must be necessary  
 
Dr Revenue  
    300 
Cr  Unearned Revenue      300 
 
Or 
 
B) Client initially records the receipt of cash as Unearned Revenue  
 
Dr Cash   
1,000  
Cr  Unearned Revenue  1,000 
 
At year end since only $700 of product has been sold, an adjusting journal entry must be necessary  
 
Dr Unearned Revenue 700 
Cr  Revenue   
 
    700  
 
Regardless of how the initial transaction was recorded, the ending balances in both the revenue and unearned 
revenue are the same - revenue is $700 and unearned revenue is $300 BUT the adjusting journal entries were 
different because the original transactions were recorded differently.

COMR 457 
 
Examples of commonly encountered adjustments continued 
 
Expenses  
 
• As with revenues, expenses must also be carefully reviewed. 
Expenses may also be over- or understated.  
 
• It is probable that expenses have been incurred but the company 
has not yet received an invoice from a supplier and therefore has 
not yet recorded the transaction. Remember expenses incurred in 
the period to generate revenue recorded in the period must be 
recorded in the same period (the matching principle). When a 
company needs to record an expense which has not yet been 
recorded in the records the adjusting journal entry is:  
 
Dr Expense  
Cr  Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities  
 
This is known as accruing (or the accrual of) expenses.  
 
• Expenses could also be understated.  Assume a company prepaid a 
one year Insurance policy on January 1st and recorded the amount in 
the Prepaid Insurance account (i.e. an asset account). At year end, 
assume the Company has not yet transferred the amount from 
Prepaid Insurance to Insurance Expense. An adjusting journal entry 
would be necessary to make the transfer at year end because the 
policy has expired. The adjusting journal entry would be:  
 
Dr Insurance Expense  
Cr  Prepaid Insurance Expense

COMR 457 
Examples of commonly encountered adjustments continued 
 
Expenses continued 
 
• Although seen less frequently, it is possible that an expense may be 
overstated. The most frequent example occurs when payment for an 
item is initially recorded in an expense account but the payment 
covers a period extending beyond the current period (i.e. some of the 
expense relates to future periods). For example, assume a company 
pays $2,400 for a two-year insurance policy on January 1, 2018 and 
records the payment in Insurance Expense account. At the end of 
2018(December 31), do you see that only half of the policy has been 
used and therefore only half of the fee should be expensed? In this 
case the adjusting journal entry should be: 
  
Dr Prepaid Insurance Expense 1,200  
Cr   
Insurance Expense   
 
1,200  
 
Note that anytime you see the word Prepaid in an account name the 
account represents an asset - Prepaid Insurance Expense is an asset 
not an expense.

Internal Allocations  
 
Although we have not yet discussed depreciation in detail, often an 
adjusting journal entry will be required to record or adjust depreciation 
expense. In simplest terms, depreciation represents the amount of an 
asset consumed in the year. While depreciation can be calculated in 
many ways, straight-line amortization is calculated as follows: 
  
Annual depreciation = Cost of the asset - residual value(*)  
                                                Useful life in years  
 
(*) Residual value is the expected selling price at the end of the asset’s 
useful life to the company  
 
The adjusting journal entry to record or adjust depreciation is: 
 
Dr Depreciation expense  
Cr   
Accumulated Depreciation  
 
Remember that Accumulated Depreciation is a contra account - it offsets 
the related asset account and is normally in a credit balance. 
 
Pages 3-21 to 3-25 provide further examples of adjusting journal entries 
and should be carefully reviewed. 
 
Materiality  
 
In practice only material adjusting journal entries are recorded - those 
that would make a difference to the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality is usually defined as a % of assets (1 -2%) or a % or net 
income (5 -10%). In our questions and exams, any difference will be 
considered material.

12 
COMR 457 
Adjusted Trial Balance 
 
Once the adjusting journal entries have been prepared, they will be 
entered onto a worksheet in order to produce an Adjusted Trial Balance. 
 
The extended columns are known as the Adjusted Trial Balance which 
should contain the correct year end balances in each account. We can 
now proceed to create the financial statements. Remember the ordering 
of the trial balance will assist us in preparing the necessary statements.  
 
Exhibits 3.13 on page 3-26 provide an example of the Adjusted Trial 
Balance while Exhibits 3.14, 3.15 & 3.16 on pages 3-27 – 3-28 provide 
examples of the financial statements. 
 
CLOSING ENTRIES  
 
At the end of the year only (i.e. not at the end of each month), 
management must ready itself for a new year. Some accounts called 
permanent (real) accounts will never be affected - i.e. assets and 
liabilities. Other accounts known as temporary (nominal) accounts must 
be reset to zero - i.e. revenues, expenses, gains, losses, dividends 
declared.  
 
In a computerized environment, you press a button for the closing 
process and everything is done for you. In a manual system the process 
is as follows: 
 
• Close each revenue and gain account to an account known as the 
Income Summary  
• Close each expense and loss account to the Income Summary  
 
 

 
 
© Scott M.  Sinclair, FCPA, FCA 2022 
 
13 
COMR 457 
CLOSING ENTRIES continued 
 
The balance in the Income Summary must equal the profit or loss from 
the Income Statement or you have made an error.  
 
• Transfer the balance in the Income Summary to the Retained 
Earnings account  
• Close dividends declared to Retained Earnings  
• The ending balance in Retained Earnings must equal the balance of 
Retained Earnings on the Balance Sheet  
 
See a detailed example on pages 3-29 - 3-30. Once these closing 
entries are posted, the ending balances in each account should equal 
the balances on the Statement of Financial Position.  
 
YOU ARE READY TO START THE PROCESS FOR THE NEXT YEAR!

I would reject this recommendation as it would further delay the receipt 
of cash for the company, and it is unlikely that their suppliers will all 
agree to extend the company's credit by another 30 days. In addition, 
it appears that there is a significant spike in the amount of uncollectible 
receivables as they get past 90 days old, which will be only 30 days 
past their proposed due date, thus likely increasing the amount of 
uncollectible accounts. The expected increased sales may be 
counteracted by an increased amount of uncollectible accounts, thus 
perhaps reducing the company's net income, rather than increasing it. 
Another consideration that should be looked at before making the 
decision is investigating the credit terms granted by the companies’ 
competitors. 
 
c. 
The company should consider attempting to collect their receivables 
more aggressively between 31-90 days, since it appears that the 
receivables that are not yet collected after 90 days show a significant 
increase in the proportion that is uncollectible.  
 
 
Another possible solution to speed up the collection of the accounts 
receivable is to offer sales discounts to some of its customers for early 
payment.

The company could also look at other steps, such as reducing credit 
sales by requiring customers seeking credit to pay with credit cards. 
The company could also look at factoring its older receivables.  While 
there will be a significant discount, it may be less than the 25% loss 
the company is currently expecting to experience as credit losses.

the period in which they are incurred.  Credit losses are a function of 
selling on account and is incurred in the period in which the credit 
sales take place. The allowance method does this, by recognizing 
bad debts expense in the period in which the sale occurs and 
providing an allowance for future write-offs.  
 
 
This provides a better measure of periodic income than the 
alternative which is the direct write-off method.  
 
 
Also, under the allowance method the accounts receivable are 
presented on the statement of financial position at a realistic amount 
(their net carrying amount), representing the amount that is actually 
expected to be collectible. By contrast, the direct write-off method 
simply reports the receivables at their gross amount, and therefore 
overstates their value.

Long-Term Assets 
 
Long-term assets, long-lived assets or capital assets refer to property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired, constructed or 
developed for long-term use in the normal course of business.  
 
Long-term assets that include tangible or intangible assets have the 
following characteristics: 
 
• Tangible assets have physical substance and are usually 
categorized as Land, Property & Plant and Natural Resources  
• Intangible assets which lack physical substance may be 
categorized as intellectual property, copyrights, patents, licenses, 
franchises, subscription lists, computer software and development 
costs.  
 
Acquisition of Assets  
 
The cost principle dictates that all costs incurred in acquiring and 
readying an asset for its intended use should be capitalized to the cost 
of the asset. These include the purchase price, legal costs, 
transportation and installation costs. If the entity purchases a used asset 
and then spends significant costs to update the asset, those costs would 
also normally be included in the cost of the asset.

2 
COMR 457 
If an entity buys a group or basket of assets for a single lump sum it is 
necessary to allocate a portion of the purchase price to each major 
category of assets. Such allocation is usually prepared using the relative 
fair market values of each category of assets purchased.  The allocation 
is important because each major category of asset will be depreciated 
differently for both accounting and income tax purposes. 
 
Ordinary Repairs, Maintenance and Extraordinary repairs 
 
In practice, assets need to be repaired or altered during their lives. We 
must determine which expenditures should be capitalized (added to the 
cost of the asset) and which ones expensed (i.e., immediately deducted 
on the Income Statement as an expense).  
 
Ongoing normal wear and tear repairs are generally expensed as 
incurred. They are usually routine in nature, relatively small and not 
expected to extend the useful life of the asset. 
 
When larger expenditures are incurred, we must determine whether the 
change has improved the productive life, operating efficiency or capacity 
of the asset.  Betterments, ones that increase the asset’s usefulness; 
enhance the productive or service potential of the asset are all added to 
the cost of an asset (i.e., not expensed in the period the expenditure 
occurs). A major overhaul, improvement or complete rebuilding of a 
significant part of an asset would usually constitute betterments and 
therefore be capitalized to the cost of the asset.   
 
Under IFRS, replacements of significant asset components are 
capitalized while the carrying value of the item replaced is derecognized.

COMR 457 
Depreciation  
 
The matching principle requires that expenses related to revenue 
recognized in a period must be recorded in the same period. An entity 
that uses its long-lived assets to generate revenue must estimate and 
recognize the amount of the assets that has been used or consumed 
during that period. This is the concept of depreciation. Depreciation is 
an attempt to allocate costs to different periods on a systematic and 
rational basis - it is not a valuation technique.  
 
As with inventory, there are alternative methods of depreciating assets. 
The textbook does a good job providing examples of three of the most 
common methods:  
• Straight-line  
• Units-of-production  
• Diminishing (Declining)-balance  
 
In order to apply these methods, I would like to ensure you understand 
two concepts: 
 
• Residual value represents management’s estimate of the amount 
the entity expects to recover upon the disposal of the assets at the 
end of its estimated useful life  
 
• Estimated useful life is management’s estimate of the asset’s 
useful economic life to the entity  
 
Please note that determining both of these estimates require 
considerable judgment

COMR 457 
 
The key to properly determining depreciation expense is to set up your 
calculations neatly and concisely. Note that straight-line method uses 
time to depreciate an asset while units-of-production uses some form of 
units (estimated output in units or activity) Take the time to organize the 
information, as the calculations are relatively mechanical.  
 
I would like to comment on the diminishing-balance and the double-
diminishing-balance methods. Both are based on the assumption that 
more of an asset is consumed in the early years of its productive life. 
Under the diminishing-balance method you establish a % by dividing 1 
by the estimated useful life. In the first year, you apply that % to the cost 
of the asset (Do not deduct the residual value as is done in the 
straight-line method and the units-of-production methods). In 
successive years, you apply the % to the carrying value of the asset (i.e., 
the cost – accumulated depreciation claimed to date). As the carrying 
value decreases so too does the yearly depreciation expense. 
 
Note that when you are using the diminishing-balance methods, the 
carrying value of the asset can never go below its estimated 
residual value. As the asset nears the end of its useful life, be careful 
to ensure you are not over depreciating the asset. Double-diminishing-
balance is calculated in exactly the same fashion except the % is twice 
that determined under diminishing-balance method. 
 
All of the depreciation amounts determined above are yearly amounts. 
Should an asset be purchased during the year, make sure you 
determine depreciation for that portion of the year for which the 
asset was used. For our purposes, we depreciate by months as 
opposed to days. Take the yearly amount and multiply it by (the number 
of months used)/12. On exams, always show your calculations.  
Administratively, assets bought in the first half of the month are 
depreciated for the whole month while those purchased in the last half 
of the month are not depreciated in the month of purchase.

COMR 457 
 
Selection of Depreciation methods 
 
Management is free to select the method that they believe is most 
appropriate for each asset group. This means that companies may 
depreciate different categories of assets using different methods.  If the 
amount of the asset consumed is fairly constant, the straight-line method 
is appropriate.  Diminishing-balance is appropriate when the asset is 
most productive early in its life while units-of-production is method is 
defined in terms of its unit of output. 
 
However, once a method is selected, changes in methods should only 
be made if there is a good reason for making a change – making a 
change to alter income would not qualify as an acceptable reason for 
changing methods. 
 
Changes in Estimates 
 
Often the useful life of an asset and/or the residual value may change 
over the life of an asset.  Consequently, you will need to revise the 
depreciation expense amounts. This is referred to as a change in 
estimate. You do not restate amounts claimed in previous years.  
Rather determine the net book value of the asset (cost minus 
accumulated depreciation) at the date of change and deduct the 
estimated residual value at that date.  Divide this difference by the 
estimated remaining life of the asset to determine the new revised 
annual depreciation expense.

The following example will help you gain a better understanding of how 
a change in estimate is calculated: 
 
Asset purchased for $100,000 with an estimated residual value of 
$10,000 and a useful life of 10 years on January 1 2019. The company 
uses the straight-line method. At the beginning of January 1, 2022, the 
company revises the total useful life of the asset to 8 years and the 
residual value to $13,000 
 
Solution 
 
Depreciation in years 2019, 2020 & 2020 = (100,000 - 10,000)/10= 
$9,000 per year 
 
Change in estimate at January 1, 2022 
 
=(Net book value – residual value)/(8-3)**  
=(100,000-27,000-13,000)/5 
= 60,000/5= $12,000 per year 
 
** Careful here, the total useful life is 8 years but as three years have 
already passed, the remaining life is 5 years.

Taxation Issues 
 
Depreciation is claimed for accounting purposes not for tax purposes. 
While we do not cover income taxes in this course, you should be aware 
that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows you to claim a 
prescribed amount – this is known as capital cost allowance and is 
often different than the amount claimed for financial statement purposes.  
This topic will be covered in intermediate accounting and your income 
tax courses. 
 
Measuring Asset Impairment 
 
Canadian accounting principles require companies to review the 
carrying value of tangible and intangible assets for possible impairment. 
It is important to understand a number of definitions. 
 
Fair value of an asset - the amount the asset can be sold for between 
two knowledgeable, willing parties.  
 
Value in use of an asset - the present value or cash equivalent of the 
future cash flows expected to be derived from the use of the asset over 
time. 
 
Recoverable amount – the higher of the value in use or its fair value 
less costs to sell. 
 
When the carrying value of the asset (cost minus accumulated 
depreciation) is greater than the recoverable amount, the asset is 
considered to be impaired.  It would be necessary to record the following 
journal entry: 
 
Dr  Loss due to impairment(I/S) 
Cr 
 
Asset (B/S)

8 
COMR 457 
This is consistent with the prudence principle we e previously discussed. 
While testing for impairment is much more complicated than outlined 
above, you should be aware of this important accounting issue.  
 
Disposal of Assets 
 
Unlike inventory, long-lived assets are not purchased with the intent of 
resale. However, they are sold, traded in or exchanged for other assets. 
When an asset is sold, the proceeds will not usually equal the net book 
value of the asset. As a result, a gain or loss may arise - not both. The 
generic journal entry to record a disposition of asset is:  
 
Dr Cash  
Dr Accumulated Depreciation 
Dr Loss on disposal of asset (*) 
Cr   
Asset  
Cr   
Gain on disposal of asset (*)  
 
(*) Gains would be recognized as credits while losses would be recorded 
as debits. Both are presented on the Income Statement.  
 
Remember to depreciate the asset to the date of disposition before 
calculating the gain or loss on disposal.

Financial Statement Analysis 
 
The Fixed asset turnover ratio measures the relationship between fixed 
assets (tangible) and sales.  It measures how effectively Property, Plant 
and Equipment have been used to produce sales.  It is calculated as: 
 
Net sales revenue/ Average net Property, Plant & Equipment 
 
For any given company, a higher rather a lower ratio is desired.  Due to 
the capital intensity of different industries, one must be careful when 
comparing companies across industries. 
 
Intangible Assets  
 
Long-lived assets which lack physical substance but convey rights or 
privileges to the owner are known as intangible assets. Common 
intangibles include: 
 
• Patents  
• Trademarks  
• Licenses  
 
Generally, they are recorded at historical cost only if purchased. The 
recognition and measurement of intangibles requires professional 
judgment and is beyond the scope of an introductory course. 
 
An intangible may have a finite or indefinite life. Those with a finite 
life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives while 
those with an indefinite life are not amortized. However, they must be 
tested for impairment on an annual basis. As with tangible assets, an 
impairment should be recorded when the recoverable amount is 
determined to be less than the carrying cost of the intangible.

I would like to discuss goodwill. In simplest terms, goodwill arises when 
one company buys another company at an amount which is greater than 
the fair market value of that company’s identifiable assets and liabilities. 
Goodwill cannot be created within a company. As with other assets 
discussed in this chapter, goodwill is also subject to impairment testing. 
 
If a company reports goodwill on its Balance Sheet, then you 
know it has paid a premium for the acquisition of another 
business.

AP7-14A The estimated cost of the inventory lost in the flooded warehouse can be 
determined by subtracting the company’s actual inventory in all other 
warehouses after the flood on April 25 from an estimate of the company’s 
total inventory on hand just before the flood. 
  
Using the cost-to-sale ratio, the company’s estimated total ending 
inventory on April 25 was: 
 
Cost of Goods Sold             = 65% of sales 
 
 
 
   
        = $1,028,000 x 65%

Chapter Eleven  
Reporting and Interpreting Shareholders’ Equity  
  
We have now completed our review of the asset and liability sections of 
the Statement of Financial Position. Let’s now turn our attention to the 
Shareholders’ Equity or the net assets section. A company may have 
been incorporated under either Provincial or Federal Company Act. 
Remember that a corporation is a separate legal entity from its 
shareholders. It may enter into contracts and is responsible for filing its 
own tax returns. Unlike a lender who loans money to the company (i.e., 
a bondholder from Chapter 10) and expects to be repaid, an investor 
who purchases shares in a company is making a permanent 
investment in the company. The company is under no obligation to 
repay any investment made by the shareholder. The shareholder is free 
to sell his/her shares to another party. The benefits of being a 
shareholder are summarized on pages 11-11 to 11-12.  
  
While some companies have more than one class of shares, most have 
only one class of shares known as common shares.  In this case, each 
shareholder must receive equal treatment. Each share entitles the 
shareholder to one vote at shareholder meetings.   
  
Shares may be issued for cash, assets or services. Shares should be 
recorded at the fair market value of the shares issued or the value of the 
consideration received by the company, whichever is more reliable. The 
maximum number of shares which a company may issue is known as 
the authorized number of shares. This number is specified in a 
company’s incorporating documents. The number of shares which have 
been issued by the company is known as the issued number of shares. 
The number of shares which are issued and held by external 
shareholders is known as the outstanding number of shares.

Issuance of Shares  
  
When common shares are issued, the journal entry is:   
  
Dr Cash  
Cr     Common shares  
  
The full amount for any consideration received is recorded in the 
Common shares account.   
  
When an investor purchases shares of a company they may have many 
objectives including gaining control of the company, profiting from an 
increase in the price of the shares and/or receiving periodic dividend 
income from their investment. The directors of the company will 
determine whether any dividend payments will be made. The directors 
are under no legal obligation to declare dividends. However, most 
investors expect and appreciate dividend payments.  
  
 
 

 
COMR 457

Cash Dividends   
  
There are three important dates with respect to dividends:  
  
 Date of Declaration – the date the dividend is declared by the 
Board of Directors and becomes a liability of the company.   
  
 Date of Record – the date that the recipient of the dividend is 
determined – i.e., the registered shareholder who is entitled to 
receive the dividend.  
  
 Date of Payment – the date the payment is actually made to the 
shareholder.  
 
Notice that the date of record is not usually the same day as the date of 
declaration. This is because large companies which have active share 
trading need time to ensure their share capital records are properly 
updated. A dividend can only be paid if the company has the cash 
necessary to make the payment and the dividend does not render the 
company insolvent. The journal entry on the declaration date is:  
  
Dr Dividends declared or Retained Earnings  
Cr    
Dividends payable  
  
Dividends declared is not an expense but rather a distribution of 
Retained Earnings. Therefore, it appears on the Statement of Retained 
Earnings. Some textbooks debit Retained Earnings as opposed to 
Dividends declared. I prefer to use Dividends declared so that opening  
Retained Earnings always equals ending Retained Earnings from the 
previous year.  
 

 
COMR 457

4   
 
Cash Dividends continued 
 
On the date of record, no entry is necessary however the company now 
can establish the name of each shareholder entitled to a dividend 
payment. Remember each share must receive the same amount of 
dividend payment.  
  
On the payment date the journal entry is:  
  
Dr Dividends payable  
Cr    
Cash   
 
Stock (Share) Dividends    
 
Although a company may have Retained Earnings (i.e., past earnings 
which have been retained by the company), it may have little cash or no 
desire to distribute any of its cash. In such cases, the Board of Directors 
may wish to make a distribution of Retained Earnings in the form of 
additional common shares. Essentially a portion of Retained Earnings 
will be reclassified to Common Shares – often referred to as 
capitalization of Retained Earnings. Each shareholder will receive a 
proportionate share of the additional shares issued. Because a Stock 
Dividend is issuable to each shareholder, each shareholder maintains 
their present % ownership interest in the company (i.e., a shareholder 
who holds a 10% interest in the company before the stock dividend will 
hold a 10% interest after the stock dividend).  As there are now more 
shares outstanding, the market price of each share will likely drop. 
However, as each shareholder owns more shares, the value of their total 
investment should remain relatively unchanged.   
 
 

 
COMR 457

5   
 
Stock Dividends continued  
 
Assume a company declares a 10% stock dividend. The journal entry on 
the date of declaration is:  
  
Dr Stock dividends declared/Retained Earnings  
Cr    
Common shares issuable  
  
The amount of the entry is determined as follows:   
  
= Number of common shares currently outstanding * 0.10 *Current 
Market value of one common share on the date of declaration.  
 
Common shares issuable is not a liability as no assets of the company 
will be used to satisfy the obligation - rather additional common shares 
will simply be issued. The account is part of Shareholders’ Equity. As 
with cash dividends, no journal entry is necessary on the date of record.  
  
When the additional shares are distributed (i.e., date of issuance) the 
following entry is necessary:  
  
Dr Common shares issuable  
Cr    
Common shares   
  
Notice that the effect of these two entries is:   
 
Dr Stock dividends declared/Retained Earnings  
Cr    
Common shares

Stock Splits  
  
In good economic times, a company may split its stock. A stock split is 
not a dividend. Generally, companies split their stocks in order to make 
the shares more affordable for investors.  A stock split will result in a 
decrease in the market price of a company’s stock.  Far more investors 
can purchase a $10 stock than a $100 stock. As with dividends, the 
Board of Directors must approve and announce a stock split. Assume a 
company announces a 3 for 1 stock split. Each shareholder will be 
entitled to receive a further 2 shares from the company for each share 
they currently own. Notice that the numbers of issued and outstanding 
shares will increase - at the conclusion of the stock split, the company 
will have three times as many shares issued and outstanding as before 
the stock split. There is no journal entry to record the entry but rather 
the number of issued and outstanding shares will be revised.  
 
Preferred Shares   
As noted above, a company may have more than one class of shares 
outstanding. Each class will entitle the shareholder to different rights. 
Preferred shareholders usually have a preference for receiving 
dividends before common shareholders. Most have a fixed dividend rate 
or amount but do not have voting rights. Investors in preferred shares 
are looking for annual dividend income and are usually more risk averse 
than common shareholders. Pages 11-13 to 11-17 does a good job of 
discussing other features that may be attached to preferred shares. The 
accounting issue that arises when both common and preferred shares 
are outstanding is determining who is entitled to any dividends declared. 
In order to make a proper determination, one must determine whether 
the preferred shares carry a cumulative or non-cumulative feature.   

 
COMR 457  
 
© Scott M.  Sinclair, FCPA, FCA  2022  
  
7   
 
Preferred Shares continued   
 
Most preferred shares have a cumulative right for dividends. A 
cumulative feature means that the right to receive a dividend for a year 
is retained by the preferred shareholder even if no dividend is declared 
for that year. The amount in respect of dividends on cumulative preferred 
shares which have not been declared in prior years is known as 
dividends in arrears. These amounts are not shown as liabilities as 
there is no legal obligation to pay them (i.e., they have not been 
declared). However, dividends in arrears should be disclosed in the 
notes to the financial statements as common shareholders should be 
aware that these dividends would have to be paid prior to the distribution 
of any dividends to common shareholders. Should preferred shares be 
noncumulative, they are only entitled to the dividend declared in the 
current year. There is no such thing as dividends in arrears on 
noncumulative preferred shares or common shares.   
  
Repurchased Shares   
  
Occasionally a company may wish to repurchase its own common 
shares. In Canada, repurchased shares usually cancelled.   
  
In accounting for the acquisition and cancellation of a company’s own 
shares, there are three scenarios which may arise:   
  
 
The shares are repurchased for an amount that is equal to the 
average issue price of the shares repurchased.   
    The shares are repurchased for an amount that is less than the 
average issue price of the shares repurchased.   
    The shares are repurchased for an amount that is more than the 
average issue price of the shares repurchased.

Repurchased Shares continued  
 
Any gain or loss realized on the above noted transactions is 
referred to as a capital transaction and is never recorded on the 
Income Statement.   
  
The journal entries for each of the above noted scenarios are:  
  
Shares purchased at average issue price:  
  
Dr Common Shares  
Cr    
Cash   
  
  
Shares purchased at a price less than the average issue price:  
  
Dr Common Shares  
Cr    
Cash  
Cr    
Contributed Surplus (part of Shareholders’ Equity)  
  
Notice that any gain is credited to an account known as Contributed 
Surplus (part of Shareholders’ Equity).  
  
Shares purchased at a price more than the average issue price:  
  
Dr Common Shares  
Dr Contributed Surplus (eliminate any balance in this account)  
Dr Retained Earnings (any difference is charged to Retained Earnings)  
Cr    
Cash

Repurchased Shares continued 
 
Notice that the debit to Common shares in all three scenarios is 
always based on the average issue price (total $ amount paid for 
Common shares /number of common shares issued and outstanding) of 
the shares repurchased. Should a loss arise, the amount should first 
eliminate any Contributed Surplus in respect of that class of shares (i.e., 
amounts which arose from previous purchase transactions in that class 
of shares) and then any remainder should be charged to Retained 
Earnings. If there is no balance in Contributed Surplus, the amount is 
charged directly to Retained Earnings.  
  
Financial Statement Analysis 
 
Earnings per share (EPS)  
  
Calculation:  
  
= Net income - preferred dividends/ Average number of common Shares 
outstanding  
  
This is a very important ratio often used by investors to gauge the 
profitability of the company.  Analysts watch EPS results very closely.

Return on Shareholders’ Equity (ROE)  
  
Calculation:  
  
= Net Income - preferred dividends / Average common Shareholders’ 
Equity   
  
Indicates the return common shareholders are earning on their 
investment - the higher the return, the more attractive the company.  
 
Price/Earnings ratio 
  
Calculation:  
  
= Current market price of a common share/ Earnings per share 
  
Indicates whether the market price of the common shares is reasonable 
in relation to the company’s earnings per share. 
 
Dividend yield ratio 
 
=Dividends per share/ Market price per share 
 
Measures the dividends an investor will receive relative to the share 
price.

unchanged. 
 
d. The company could use the issuance of shares instead of cash as 
a way of satisfying their shareholders’ request for dividends while 
conserving their cash. It also has the positive effect of capitalizing 
an amount of retained earnings, recording the fair value of the 
shares issued as share capital.

Chapter Four 
Revenue Recognition and the Statement of Income 
 
As previously noted, users follow an entity’s revenue very closely.  
Increasing revenues allow companies to expand and lead to increasing 
share prices.  There is tremendous pressure on management of public 
companies to reach targeted revenue forecasts.  Such pressure 
unfortunately leads to manipulation of revenue amounts. 
 
Recall from Chapter 2 that entities must use the accrual basis of 
accounting and recognize (i.e. record) revenue when earned.  In many 
situations, determining whether revenue is earned is not easy as one 
may think. 
 
There are two issues to address with revenue recognition.  First when 
should an amount be recognized in the financial statements 
(recognition) and second at what amount (measurement)?  As the 
method of revenue recognition needs to be understood, all entities must 
disclose their revenue recognition policies in the notes to their financial 
statements. 
 
Watch for news stories identifying companies that have fraudulently 
overstated income by prematurely recognizing revenue or recording 
fictitious revenue.  When discovered, these entities must restate their 
previously released financial statements and often face fines, sanctions 
and class-action lawsuits.  Having to restate a financial statement may 
negatively affect the reputation of that entity - i.e. shareholders may 
question the reliability of any of the entity’s financial information and the 
integrity of management.

COMR 457 
Companies reporting under ASPE use an earnings-based 
approach: 
 
For Sale of Goods 
 
Revenue should be recorded when all of the following conditions are 
have been satisfied: 
 
• The entity has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership of the goods? This is usually the transfer of 
legal title. 
 
• The seller has no continuing involvement or control over the goods. 
 
• The amount of consideration to be received can be measured with 
reasonable assurance. 
 
• Collection is reasonably assured. 
 
 
For provision of services: 
 
Revenue should be recorded when all of the following conditions are 
have been satisfied: 
 
• The service has been performed. 
• The amount of consideration to be received can be measured with 
reasonable assurance. 
• Collection is reasonably assured.

COMR 457 
Companies reporting under IFRS use a contract-based approach: 
 
The standard setters have adopted a contract-based approach that 
focuses on the contracts a company has with its customers.  The 
contract creates a combination of rights – rights to receive consideration 
and performance obligations. 
 
Management uses the following steps to determine when to recognize 
revenue: 
 
• Identify the contract 
• Identify the performance obligations 
• Determine the transaction price 
• Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations 
• Recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. 
 
Pages 4-5 to 4-12 provide further detail and examples that I encourage 
you to review.  
 
Rights of Returns 
 
In many sales transactions, the entity allows customers the right to 
return goods within a certain time frame. As a result, the entity must 
attempt to estimate the amount of refunds in the same period as the sale 
is recognized.  Failure to make an estimate at the time of recognition 
would overstate sales.

COMR 457 
Warranties 
 
When an entity provides a warranty against defects of its products and 
the warranty is part of the sales transaction, the entity has a performance 
obligation (i.e. a liability) which must be established when the sale is 
recognized (assurance warranty).  As with rights of return, significant 
judgment is required in establishing the amount to record.  Usually, the 
amount is based on historical warranty claims history. Actual claims 
would reduce the liability established. 
 
If the entity sells an extended warranty which is not a part of the initial 
sales transaction (service warranty) then this transaction would be 
considered a separate transaction.  In most cases the amount charged 
to the customer would be set up as deferred revenue and recognized as 
revenue over the period of the warranty.  Actual claims would be 
recorded as received. 
 
The Income Statement 
 
Recall that an income statement is prepared to measure the operating 
performance of an entity for a period of time.  Revenues, gains, 
expenses and losses are recorded on this statement.  While 
management does have flexibility in the format of the statement, there 
are generally two basis approaches: 
 
• Single-step – the most simplistic format in which all revenues 
regardless of source are listed first followed by all expenses. 
 
•  Multiple-step – a more refined approach in which there are 
multiple sub totals that provide the reader with key measures 
including gross profit, operating profit and income before income 
taxes. 
 
There are good examples in Exhibits 4.4 & 4.5 of the textbook.

Captions commonly found items on an Income Statement 
 
Revenue – revenue earned from the normal operations of the entity.  
When there are many different lines of business the revenue may be 
divided even further. 
 
Cost of Goods sold – the cost of the products sold 
 
Gross Margin (Profit) is the difference between Sales and Cost of 
goods sold. This is an important item for most retail operations. 
Management watches this line very closely.  Note that a service 
organization would not have a cost of goods sold nor a gross margin. 
 
Operating costs represent the expenses incurred in the normal course 
of business – e.g. salary expense, hydro, rent etc. Companies have 
flexibility in presenting this information. 
 
Operating profit equals gross margin less operating expenses. 
 
Other Income/Expenses - Items that are not central to continuing 
operations such as investment income, rental income, or interest 
expense are usually shown after operating profit. 
 
Interest expense – finance and borrowing costs  
 
Profit before income taxes - sum or all income minus expenses except 
taxes and results of investments in associated companies. 
  
Income tax expense - this is a cost of running a business and therefore 
properly shown on the income statement. 
 
Profit for the year - profit from continuing operations

Earnings per share - another closely monitored ratio, calculates the 
amount of profit earned by each share.  
 
= (Net income – Preferred dividends)/ the weighted average number of 
common shares outstanding during the year.  
 
 
Discontinued Operations 
 
If an entity discontinues a segment of its business, the income or loss 
from that segment should be shown as a separate line item on the 
income statement.  Why?  Because a reader should understand that this 
amount is not expected to occur in the future.  Such information is 
relevant – it has predictive value! 
 
Public Companies – Statement of Comprehensive Income 
 
Public companies prepare a Statement of Comprehensive Income. This 
statement includes the Income Statement as described above and a 
second component known as Other Comprehensive Income.  This 
second component includes gains and losses from revaluing financial 
statement items to fair value or from changes in foreign currency rates.  
 
The details of discontinued operations and comprehensive income are 
discussed in Intermediate Accounting.

Appendix A 
Recording of Sales 
 
In many situations revenue is recognized when title to the product is 
transferred from the seller to the buyer. There are two shipping terms 
you will often encounter and need to understand:  
 
• FOB shipping point – title to the goods passes to the buyer when 
the goods are shipped  
 
• FOB destination – title to the goods passes to the buyer when the 
goods are delivered  
 
(FOB means “free on board”) 
 
The selling price of the product is often dependent on the quantity 
ordered by a customer. Those who buy more are often afforded lower 
unit prices. The ultimate sales price times quantity sold is referred 
to/recorded as gross sales.  
 
Some customers may be granted credit (i.e. the ability to pay their 
account after 30 or 60 days) while others may have to pay cash or settle 
their account with a credit card. When the textbook discusses credit 
sales or sales on account they are referring to situations where credit 
has been granted.  It is not referring to sales settled with credit cards.  
We will address sales on account in Chapter 6.

COMR 457 
The journal entry to record a sale with cash is:  
 
Dr Cash  
Cr           Sales  
 
The journal entry to record a sale on account is:  
 
Dr Accounts (Trade) Receivables  
Cr            Sales  
 
The journal entry to record a sale paid with a credit card is:  
 
Dr Cash  
Dr Credit card charge (*)  
Cr            Sales  
 
(*) Remember from the seller’s point of view, the bank charges a fee 
when a customer uses their credit card.   
 
As discussed, cash flow is the lifeblood of an entity. If management 
cannot collect it accounts receivables quickly the entity will be required 
to borrow funds to finance operations. To entice customers to pay 
quickly some companies offer a sales discount – a discount for early 
payment.  You will often see the following notation on the bottom of a 
sales invoice:  
 
Terms 30 days – this means the amount is due within 30 days of the 
invoice date  
 
Terms 2/10, n/30 – this means the seller will grant a 2% discount if the 
invoice is paid within 10 days. Should the discount not be taken, the full 
amount of the invoice is due within 30 days.  
Terms vary among industries- some grant generous terms while others 
offer no discounts.

COMR 457 
Sales discounts, returns & allowances 
Sales discounts are offered to encourage customers to pay their 
accounts promptly. When a customer takes a sales discount (i.e., a 
discount for early payment) the seller would record the following entry:  
 
Dr Cash  
Dr Sales Discount  
Cr           Accounts (Trade) Receivables  
 
The Sales Discount account is a contra account - an account that offsets 
the sales account in the Income Statement.   
 
After purchasing a product, a customer may wish to return a product 
they have purchased or ask for a reduction in price because the product 
is either damaged or not exactly what was ordered. Each scenario will 
be discussed separately. 
 
Sales Returns arise when a customer returns a product. The seller 
would record the transaction as follows:  
 
Dr Sale returns  
Cr         Accounts (Trade) Receivables  
 
Notice that the debit goes to Sales Returns (another contra account) not 
the Sales account. Management usually sets up a Sales Returns 
account so they can monitor the level of returns.  
 
Sales Allowances arise when a customer requests and is granted an 
allowance (i.e., a reduction in the initial sales price), the entry recorded 
by the seller is:  
 
Dr Sales Allowances  
Cr           Accounts (Trade) Receivables  
The Sales Allowance account is another contra account.

1. a.  The performance obligation is one year of coverage under the insurance 
policy starting February 1, 2024. 
    b.  The transaction price is $1,800, the price of the policy. 
    c. 
 When the performance obligation(s) would be satisfied: The $1,800 
collected on January 28 should be recorded initially as deferred revenue 
by the insurance company, and then, beginning in February, 1/12 of this 
amount will be recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue and an 
increase in revenue at the end of each month, as the performance 
obligation for the month has been satisfied. 
 
 
2. a. 
The performance obligation is that Porter Airlines will provide you with a 
one-way flight home for Christmas. 
b.  The transaction price is $398, the price of the ticket. 
c.  When the performance obligation(s) would be satisfied: Porter Airlines 
should record the $398 as deferred revenue when they receive the cash 
in October.  When the flight is provided by Porter at Christmas time, 
deferred revenue would be reduced and revenue increased by $398.  
Even though the ticket is non-refundable, Porter has not satisfied the 
performance obligation until they provide the flight. 
 
 
3. a. 
The performance obligation is providing the dental checkup on April 5,

checkup is performed on April 5, 2024. The dentist should record $125 as 
revenue on April 5, 2024 and an account receivable for the payment that 
is due within 30 days.

4. a.  The performance obligation is allowing the ticket holder to watch the 41 
Winnipeg Jets games in their assigned seat. 
b. 
The transaction price is $6,087. 
c.  When the performance obligation(s) would be satisfied: After each game 
is completed, the performance obligation for that game is satisfied. The 
Winnipeg Jets should recognize the collection of $6,087 as deferred 
revenue when they receive the cash in July, 2024.  As each of the 41 
games is played during the season, the Jets would recognize part of the 
revenue (i.e., 1/41) and so reduce deferred revenue and increase 
revenue.  This is the case whether or not you attend all of the games. 
The onus is on the Jets to provide games, and their performance 
obligation is satisfied as each game is played.

1. a.  The performance obligation is the delivery of the printer 
 
b.  The transaction price is the price of the printer. 
 
c. Best Buy should record revenue for the printer when they have completed 
the performance obligation – which would be indicated by delivering the 
printer to you on June 18. 
 
This is the provision of goods.  There is a distinct point in time when the 
risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the buyer. After this point, Best 
Buy has no further involvement with the printer. Since you paid with your 
credit card, Best Buy is assured of payment.  Best Buy would have accurate 
records of their cost to purchase the printer from their supplier, and would 
have accurate information on shipping costs if they paid for them. 
Depending on Best Buy’s return policy, an allowance for returns may need 
to be estimated.  
 
2. a.  The performance obligation is providing you with the furniture. 
 
b.  The transaction price is $1,100 
 
c.  Leon’s should recognize revenue when the furniture was picked up by 
you.  Delayed payment terms do not impact the recognition of revenue 
unless eventual payment is at risk. The performance obligation is met on 
December 19, 2024 when the furniture is sold to you. 
 
This is the provision of goods.  The risks and rewards of ownership transfer 
to the buyer when the furniture is delivered. After this point, Leon’s has no 
further involvement with the furniture. Since the first payment is not due until 
January 2, 2026, there may be some risk that you will not pay.  Leon’s would 
estimate the risk of non-payment based on their historical experience.  
Depending on Leon’s return policy, an allowance for returns may also have 
to be recorded.

3.  a.  The performance obligation is providing access to the VIA rail service for 
April, May and June 2024. 
 
b.  The transaction price is $500 
 
c.  The performance obligation would be satisfied when each month is 
completed and access to the VIA rail service is provided. 1/3 of the 
transaction price can be recognized at the end of each month. 
 
4. a.  The performance obligations include providing you with an iPhone and the 
data plan for 2 years. This is a multiple performance obligation transaction, 
including both goods and services. The phone (goods) is provided at the 
beginning of the contract. However, the service is provided evenly over 
the contract period.   
b. 
The transaction price is $50 x 24 months = $1,200.  Rogers would need to 
determine the normal selling price of the phone and of the service 
separately.  The total revenue of $50 per month should be prorated 
between the phone (delivered) and the service (to be delivered). 
c.  The phone revenue would be recognized when delivered as the 
performance obligation is satisfied. The data plan would be recognized at 
the end of each month as the service has been provided, which satisfies 
the service performance obligation.

Question 
Analysis 
Step 1: Is there a contract? Yes, both parties have agreed to enter into a 
contract.  The quantity, price, and payment 
terms have been agreed to and each party’s 
rights under the contract are clear. The 
contract is consistent with both parties’ lines of 
business, 
meaning 
it 
has 
commercial 
substance.  There are no indications of any 
concerns regarding collectibility as goods are 
paid for at the time of ordering. 
Step 2: What performance 
obligations are included in 
the contract? 
There are two obligations under contract: 
hardware 
and 
software, 
and 
consulting 
services. 
Step 3: What is the 
transaction price? 
The transaction price is $6,097,000 for the 
goods. 
Service 
revenues 
are 
earned 
separately from the sale of goods and are not 
provided as part of a bundled sale. 
Step 4: How should the 
transaction price be 
allocated to the 
performance obligations? 
The services are not bundled so the revenue 
does not have to be allocated between 
hardware and software sales and consulting 
services. 
Step 5: Has a performance 
obligation been satisfied? 
Revenue would be recognized once the 
hardware and software has been delivered. 
For the consulting services, they would be 
recognized when completed, therefore the 
$260,000 of revenue that has been received 
but not completed, would not be recognized, as 
the performance obligation has not yet been 
satisfied. 
 
c.  Yes, the cost of goods sold is the cost of the hardware and software 
being provided to the customers. 
 
d. 
Utilities, rent, insurance, depreciation, income tax expense, etc, 
answers will vary.

Correct balance of prepaid rent at Dec. 31, 2024 = December 
31’s prepayment of $4,000 for January, 2025. Therefore, the 
balance of Prepaid Rent account must be brought to $4,000. 
($46,000 - $4,000 = $42,000).  
 
Alternatively, rent expense for year = ($3,000 x 6) + ($4,000 x 
6) = $42,000.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS 
 
AP12-6A 
a.  Inventory turnover: 
 
  Ken’s Fresh Fruits:  
$9,875,600 / [($695,000 + $695,600) / 2] = 14.2 times 
 
  Al’s Supermarket:  
 
 
 
$53,885,000 / [($4,776,500 + $1,040,500) / 2] = 18.5 times 
 
 
b. Days to sell inventory ratio: 
 
  Ken’s Fresh Fruits: 365 / 14.2 = 25.7 days 
  Al’s Supermarket: 365 / 18.5 = 19.7 days 
 
c. The inventory turnover for a food store, especially one carrying 
perishable fruit and vegetables, should be high because food has a very 
limited shelf life and must be turned over fast so that spoilage does not 
occur.  Therefore, considering that inventory, including non-perishables, 
for these companies is held for less than one month on average, the 
ratios appear reasonable.  Both companies appear to be managing their 
inventory reasonably well, although Al’s Supermarket has almost a one-
week better turnover. This would not be expected since a supermarket 
would carry more non-perishable items in addition to fresh produce and 
would be able to accommodate a lower turnover. Al’s Supermarket is 
managing its inventory more efficiently.

d. While Al's Supermarket appears to be managing their inventory better 
than Ken's Fresh Fruits, we cannot say that they are more profitable. 
Perhaps Ken’s Fresh Fruits also carries many non-perishables, but 
specializes in maintaining a superior fruit and vegetable section and can 
charge more for its produce. That is, the company name might represent 
the original strategy of the company in the past. We need more 
information, such as segmented information for the produce department 
of each. 
 
e. Fast inventory turnovers could be an indication that not enough 
inventory is being held.  Because inventory is held to support the sales 
function, potential sales can be lost. Shortages might also result in the 
loss of customers if not enough inventory is maintained. If Ken’s Fresh 
Fruits deals only in fresh fruit, the turnover ratios developed for the 
company should be a concern.

From the ratios calculated, it appears that the culinary lessons business 
has added substantially to the profitability of the company. 
 
The initial decision might be to emphasize the online lessons business as 
it appears to have a higher rate of gross margin and of profit to sales than 
does the diner, judging from the effect on the overall company ratios. This 
should be looked at more closely before making any final decision, 
however. The cost of goods sold has increased little, so further 
investigation of labour costs relative to the culinary lessons, for example 
should be carried out. Is the online lessons business using idle labour it 
would otherwise have to pay for if the diner were not operating or were 
downsized? Further, if diner sales were sacrificed, the online business 
would then have to cover more of the occupancy costs and other fixed 
costs associated with the property and equipment, interest costs and 
management salaries. In such a case, the results that appear to be 
attributed to the online culinary lessons operation would not continue as 
above.

The ratios indicate that the company is healthy as far as liquidity is 
concerned as its current assets are well in excess of its current liabilities. 
It is more liquid in 2024 than in 2023. This is evidenced by the fact that 
the increases in cash, receivables, and inventory are significantly higher 
than the increases in the related current liabilities such as accounts 
payable.

period 
365 days      = 29.4 days 
   12.4 
 
The company is collecting its receivables on average in 29.4 days. This 
collection period is reasonable, since the terms offered is due in 30 days. 
Sales at the diner using credit card are “cash” when the credit card slips 
are deposited with the bank.

Under the assumption that 50% of the sales and all the receivables come 
from the online culinary lessons, it appears that the lessons business 
receivables are not well-managed. As indicated above, payment is 
expected 30 days after the lessons are held. It takes close to two months 
for these receivables to be collected. This situation would be worrisome 
to me as a manager or as an analyst.

seems to be a low inventory turnover and a lengthy number of days to sell.  
It may point to a high risk of spoilage or that the company is not using the 
freshest ingredients in the meals it prepares. If we assumed that half of 
the cost of goods sold is labour cost related to preparation of meals, the 
ratio becomes far more reasonable.

Assuming the suppliers’ terms are 15-day terms, Pure Eating is, on 
average, over 16 days late paying the suppliers. If we assumed that half 
of the cost of goods sold is labour cost related to preparation of meals, 
the ratio becomes far less reasonable. 
 
g. Using the analysis of the receivables and payables from above, I would 
recommend that the credit period be significantly reduced, even to the 
extent that the online culinary lessons should be sold on a “cash-on-
delivery”, or on a seven-day payment basis.  The company may also 
want to request deposits from the culinary lessons (i.e. 20% up front). 
With the cash from the receivables coming in faster, the company should 
be able to pay its suppliers in 15 days, the credit period set out by its 
suppliers. The company may even be able to take advantage of cash 
discounts offered by its suppliers.

h. A segmented analysis would be useful to determine the results of each of 
the company’s operations. This would be particularly useful if gross  margins 
could be developed and turnover ratios could also be calculated for each 
segment. Because many of the occupancy and management costs are likely 
fixed in nature, some reasonable basis would have to be found to allocate 
these costs to each product line, or there could be no allocation of these 
due to their nature.

Inventory 
 
Inventory is usually the largest current asset on the Balance Sheet. 
Inventory is an asset that is either held for sale or used to produce goods 
for resale. Manufacturing companies usually disclose three types of 
inventories:  
 
• Raw materials  
• Work-in-process  
• Finished goods  
 
The cost of inventory is equal to its purchase price plus any other costs 
incurred in bringing the inventory to its intended location ready for sale.  
Those costs include transportation costs, duties, non-refundable taxes 
and any other costs incurred to ready the inventory for sale. 
 
Control of Inventory  
 
Good internal control should ensure inventory is stored in a safe and 
controlled environment. Only authorized personnel should have access 
to inventory and proper records should be maintained to account for its 
movement. Physical inventory counts should be done on a periodic 
basis to verify amounts shown in the accounting records agree to actual 
inventory amounts on hand – the same reason for preparing a bank 
reconciliation. Recall the importance of having inventory functions 
completed by different employees.  Segregation of duties prevents one 
person from ordering, receiving, shipping and accounting for inventory.

COMR 457 
Inventory Systems 
 
There are two inventory systems commonly encountered - perpetual 
and periodic. In a perpetual inventory, management maintains an 
ongoing detailed record of each product. The records could track 
quantity, cost or both. Management may at any time determine the 
number/cost of items in stock. This information is important to those 
industries that either carry expensive or unique items or require up-to-
date inventory levels.  
 
In a perpetual inventory system, the inventory account is updated each 
time new inventory is purchased or inventory is sold. The journal entry 
to purchase inventory is:  
 
Dr Inventory  
Cr  Accounts Payable  
 
When inventory is sold, there are two journal entries:  
 
Record the sale: 
 
Dr Cash/Trade receivables 
Cr 
Sales 
 
Record the Cost of goods sold 
 
Dr Cost of goods sold  
Cr  Inventory

COMR 457 
A periodic system does not maintain up-to-date records. Rather 
inventory levels are only determined when an inventory count is 
completed - usually at year end. In a periodic system, the inventory 
account is only adjusted at year end when the count is completed. 
 
At the beginning of the year, the inventory amount is equal to the amount 
determined by the inventory count completed at the end of the previous 
year. The balance in the inventory account will not change until the 
closing process at the end of the year.  
 
There are no entries for cost of goods sold as sales are recorded. I will 
not go through the entries in a periodic system but I want you to 
understand that cost of goods sold will be determined/derived at the 
end of the year as follows:  
 
Beginning inventory  
+ Net Purchases in the year (*)  
Cost of Goods Available for Sale  
Less Ending inventory (amount determined by a physical count)  
Cost of Goods Sold  
 
(*) Net purchases equal purchases minus purchase allowances, 
discounts and returns. 
 
Although you are not responsible for journal entries under a 
periodic system, please refer to Exhibit 7.5 on page 7-11 for an 
excellent comparison between the perpetual and periodic systems.

COMR 457 
Inventory Cost flow Assumptions  
 
As noted above, the real issue with inventory and cost of goods 
sold is determining how costs are to be allocated between the two 
accounts. Remember that Cost of Goods Available for Sale is equal 
to Beginning inventory + Net Purchases. When the purchase price of 
items is constant, the choice of cost flow assumptions is irrelevant - all 
cost methods will produce the same net income and ending inventory 
amount for each period. However, when the cost price of items 
purchased for inventory is changing (as is usually the case), the 
selection of a cost flow assumption will have a direct effect on the 
valuation of ending inventory, cost of goods sold and net income. In 
Canada there are three different cost flow assumptions. 
  
Before outlining each assumption, remember that the physical flow 
of goods may be different than the cost flow assumption adopted 
by the entity. 
  
First-in, First-out (FIFO) 
 
Under this method, the first items purchased into Inventory are assumed 
to the first ones allocated to cost of goods sold. In a period of rising 
prices, this means the oldest prices (i.e., the cheapest ones) are 
included in cost of goods sold while the most recent prices (i.e., the 
higher ones) are included in ending inventory. In a period of rising 
prices, FIFO will result in the highest net income and the highest 
ending inventory amount.

COMR 457 
Specific identification 
 
This method tracks specific costs with specific goods. It is usually 
chosen for expensive or unique goods. Cost of goods sold is 
determined, as the name implies, specifically with the goods sold in the 
period while ending inventory is determined based on the specific items 
remaining in ending inventory. Use of this cost flow assumption requires 
very detailed information and is therefore expensive.  This will not be 
examined any further in this class. 
 
Weighted average 
 
This method determines the average unit cost by dividing the cost of 
goods available for sale ($) by the number of units available (#). The 
average unit cost is then used to determine the amounts for ending 
inventory and for cost of goods sold. You simply multiply the number of 
units sold and the number on hand by the average cost per unit. In a 
perpetual system, this cost method is commonly known as moving-
weighted average. 
 
Selection of an Inventory Cost Flow policy 
 
The choice of a cost flow assumption is left to management. The 
objective should be the fairest matching of costs to revenue - another 
professional judgment call! Once adopted, consistency requires 
management to maintain a chosen policy unless there is a good reason 
to change. Different categories of inventory may be accounted for by 
different cost flow assumptions.  
 
Another method allowed under US GAAP is Last-in, First-out (LIFO).  Under this 
method, the most recent costs are assumed to be assigned to cost of goods sold 
first. In a period of rising prices, this produces a higher cost of goods sold amount 
and therefore a lower ending inventory and net income. This would minimize 
current income taxes and, for this reason, is often selected my management. LIFO 
is not allowed in Canada for either accounting or taxation purposes.

COMR 457 
Examples 
 
Please refer to my Inventory handouts which provide detailed examples 
of FIFO, LIFO and Weighted average cost flow methods under both a 
perpetual and periodic inventory system. 
 
Remember the company must disclose which inventory cost flow 
assumption has been adopted in the significant accounting policy note. 
 
Valuation at Lower of Cost and Net Realizable Value (LCNRV)  
 
Unless advised otherwise, the value of ending inventory on the Balance 
Sheet should be its cost as determined by one of the cost flow 
assumptions discussed above. Should the entity be unable to recover 
the stated cost, prudence dictates that management should reduce the 
value to an amount expected to be realized (NRV). This is the concept 
of lower of cost and NRV. NRV is usually calculated as selling price less 
estimated costs of selling the item.  
 
The journal entry to record such a write-down is:  
 
Dr Cost of goods sold or write-down of inventory  
Cr   
Inventory or Inventory Valuation account  
 
While inventory can never be written up above its initial cost, a previous 
write-down could be reversed in a future period should NRV increase. 
This will be discussed in more detailed in intermediate accounting 
classes

COMR 457 
Inventory Errors  
 
Inventory errors arise because of errors occurring at the inventory count, 
the pricing of ending inventory, and/or data entry. If ending inventory is 
understated, cost of goods sold is overstated. Conversely if ending 
inventory is overstated, cost of goods sold is understated. An over- or 
understatement in cost of goods sold results in a direct under- or 
overstatement of net income.  
 
Errors in ending inventory of the current year affect net income of the 
current year and net income of the following year. For example, an 
overstatement in ending inventory in the current year understates cost 
of goods sold in the current year which overstates net income in the 
current year. As a result of this error, opening inventory of the following 
year is now overstated resulting in cost of goods sold of the following 
year being overstated and net income of the following year being 
understated.  
 
Assuming there are no other inventory errors, the error corrects itself by 
the end of the following year (self-correcting error). Retained Earnings 
at the end of the second year is properly stated but the allocation of 
income between the two years is affected.  
 
Please refer to my inventory handout which provides an example of the 
effects of an inventory error.

Financial Statement Analysis  
 
Management needs to determine whether it is carrying excessive or 
inadequate levels of inventory- i.e., is it managing inventory effectively?  
 
Inventory Turnover ratio 
This ratio attempts to help an entity gauge the effectiveness of inventory 
management.  
 
Calculation  
 
= Cost of Goods Sold/Average inventory  
 
A higher number indicates that inventory is turning over more quickly. A 
lower number or a trend downwards may be indicative of old or obsolete 
inventory or excessive inventory levels. 
 
Days to sell inventory 
 
The ratio determines how many days, on average, it took the entity to 
sell its inventory 
 
Calculation 
 
= 365/Inventory turnover ratio  
 
The higher the ratio, the more concerned management should be that 
they have excessive levels of inventory.  It might highlight the 
existence of obsolete/damaged items.

The company’s estimates with respect to warranty expenditures are 
consistently higher than the actual costs the company is incurring. The 
company should decrease its estimates of defect rates or the average cost 
to repair or replace a defective unit. 
 
However, the information provided does not allow us to determine if it is 
the pattern of when the items are discovered to be defective that is the 
problem, or the number of units that prove defective or the average cost 
to rectify the deficiency that is the source of the lower-than-expected 
warranty costs in the above analysis. Further information is required.

e. To: University Survival Magazine Owners 
From: Your name, Accountant 
Re: Results of operations to December 31 
 
The results of operations for the six months ended December 31 is 
net income of $4,000.  This is substantially less than the current 
positive bank balance of $30,000.  The reasons for this $26,000 
difference are twofold. First, revenues are recognized as part of your 
income (loss) only when they are earned: $12,000 of the cash 
received on subscriptions won’t be recognized in income until the next 
term, nor will $10,000 of the advertising revenue received in cash be 
recognized until the January to April period.  The cash from both the 
subscriptions and the advertising was put in the bank when it was 
received, but $22,000 of revenue from these two items won’t be 
recognized in income until the next year.   
 
The second reason is that your expenses (which reduce reported 
income) include $4,000 of amounts that are still payable. They have 
not yet been paid for in cash. 
 
The total of the $22,000 related to revenue and the $4,000 related to 
expenses explains why your cash balance is $26,000 more positive 
than your reported net income.  This amount can be seen as the sum 
of the accounts payable of $4,000 and the deferred revenue of 
$10,000 + $12,000 on your statement of financial position.

a. Virtual Chef will record the amount of $780,000 as deferred revenue for the 
current year.  However, at the end of January the company has provide one 
month of service of two meals a week for four weeks. By providing a bonus 
for the month of December the company is essentially provide 13 months 
worth of meals.  As such the balance in the deferred revenue account at 
the end of January should be $720,000 ($780,000 – ($780,000/13)). In 
December, the company would record as revenue the equivalent of two 
months or $120,000. There is no additional liability as a result of the bonus 
meals offered to subscribers. The difference relates to how revenue is 
recognized over the equivalent of 13 months as opposed to 12 months.

In the first year, 76% of the credit amounts were redeemed and revenue of 
$94,620 [(.76) x $124,500] could be recognized related to them. The 
remaining liability related to credits granted after redemption is $29,880 
($124,500 - $94,620). 
 
c. The current portion of the debt – $50,000 – reported as a current liability. 
The long-term liability amount is zero as it will be fully repaid in 2025. 
 
d. The company increases a liability for amounts received as deposits and 
reduces the same liability for amounts paid back to its customers when the 
returnable containers are returned. Assuming the liability qualifies as a 
current liability, the balance of this current liability account will be $20,000 
higher at its current year end than the balance at the end of the previous 
year ($245,000 - $225,000).

making good on the product warranties in the current year related to the 
sales of product in the current year, the $150,000 would be debited to (and 
therefore, would reduce) the warranty provision account. The balance at the

Chapter Two  
Analyzing Transactions and Their Effects on Financial 
Statements 
 
In this chapter we focus our attention on recording and summarizing the 
transactions entered into by the entity. Before commencing our journey, 
a review of the qualitative characteristics of financial information, the 
assumptions and accounting principles underlying financial reporting is 
helpful starting point.  
Scott M. Sinclair, FCPA, FCA 2018 Scott M. Sinclair, FCPA, FCA 2018 
 
The qualitative characteristics of financial information include: 
 
Fundamental Characteristics 
• Relevance- capable of influencing the decision of a user – could 
confirm what has happened (confirmatory value) or assist in 
making predictions (predictive value) 
• Faithful representation – complete, neutral, freedom from error 
 
Enhancing Characteristics 
• Comparability – able to compare with other periods or 
competitors 
• Verifiability – able to be verified by another accountant 
• Timeliness – available in time to aid decision makers 
• Understandability – able to be understood by a knowledgeable 
user 
 
One must always remember to focus on transactions which are material 
(i.e. ones that could affect a user’s decision) and keep in mind the cost 
of obtaining versus the benefit of that information.

COMR 457 
The assumptions underlying financial statements include:  
 
• Separate-Entity - include the assets and liabilities of the entity - 
not the personal assets and liabilities of the owners of the entity  
• Unit-of-measure - financial information is reported in terms of the 
national monetary unit – no adjustment is made for changes in 
purchasing power of that unit  
• Continuity (Going Concern) - the entity will continue operations 
in the foreseeable future (i.e., at least the next 12 months)  
• Periodicity - results can be reported on a periodic basis. 
 
 
The Accounting Principles include: 
 
• Historical cost - assets are recorded at the actual cost to the entity  
• Revenue Recognition- revenue should be recognized in the 
Income Statement when it has been earned. Certain criteria must 
be met in order to recognize the revenue  
• Matching - expenses incurred to generate the revenues 
recognized must be recognized or matched to those revenues in 
the same period.  
• Full disclosure – Financial statements should make full disclosure 
of information relating to the entity 
 
Further information may be found in Section 1000 of the CPA Handbook 
(ASPE) and in IASB Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of 
Financial Statements and the Conceptual Framework (IFRS).

COMR 457 
Cash versus Accrual Basis of Accounting 
 
There are two basic approaches for recording transactions - the cash 
and accrual basis of accounting.  Let’s review the two approaches. 
 
Cash Basis  
 
• Recognizes revenues only when cash is received 
• Recognizes expenses only when cash is paid 
 
Notice that the income is determined by the receipt or payment of cash.  
Such an approach may not capture the substance of a transaction – an 
entity could sell a product on credit.  Because no cash was received, no 
revenue would be recorded.  Do you see that management could 
manipulate income simply by delaying or speeding up cash payments or 
receipts?  For these reasons, the cash approach is not considered 
GAAP and therefore not widely used. 
 
Accrual Basis 
 
• Recognizes revenues when earned 
• Recognizes expenses when incurred to earn the related 
revenue 
 
Notice that there is no mention of cash.  The focus is on the substance 
of the transaction - if revenue is earned or an expense is incurred, it 
should be recognized. 
 
Accounting standard setters have concluded that financial statements 
prepared under an accrual basis provide users with information that is 
more relevant and representationally faithful than those prepared under 
the cash basis.  Therefore, the accrual basis forms the basis for the 
remainder of this course.

COMR 457 
Recording Transactions 
 
An event is defined to be an item which will have an economic impact 
on an entity. A transaction, on the other hand, is an event which has 
an immediate effect on an item in the accounting equation and therefore 
must be recorded in the accounting process. Only transactions will be 
recorded in the financial statements. In order to produce accurate and 
complete financial statements all transactions need to be recorded. 
Signing a contract will affect future of the entity but would not be 
recorded unless there was an immediate effect on an asset, liability or 
equity account.  
 
Other textbooks state that transactions include external events which 
are exchanges of assets, goods or services by one party for assets, 
services or promises to pay (liabilities) by one or more other parties. 
Transactions also include certain events that occur within the entity 
itself. 
 
An account is a standardized format that entities use to accumulate the 
effect of transactions. Entities create an account for each item they wish 
to track. A chart of accounts is a listing of all accounts which an entity 
has established to account for its transactions. A larger and more 
complex entity requires a longer chart of accounts. Regardless of the 
size of the entity, the chart of accounts is usually presented in the 
following order:  
 
• Assets  
• Liabilities  
• Shareholders’ Equity  
• Revenues  
• Expenses  
• Gains and losses

COMR 457 
Recording Transactions Continued 
 
The starting point in any accounting system is therefore to identify all 
transactions which affect an entity. This means you need to 
understand the business, the transactions and then determine 
which accounts are affected. Ask yourself: has an account increased 
or decreased? In the back of your mind remember the Accounting 
Equation (Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity).  
 
The textbook does a very good job introducing analyzing transactions 
using the template approach.  While this method allows you to better 
understand and identify the effect individual transactions have on 
various accounts, such a process is time consuming and impractical for 
large entities. 
 
I suggest you work through the textbook examples on pages 2-13 - 2-
25.  I think you will quickly learn that practice is the most effective way 
to learn accounting. 
 
Using the accounting equation template allows you to record 
transactions in an excel spreadsheet and determine ending balances for 
each account.  Financial statements can then be prepared.  Generally, 
the Income Statement is prepared first, followed by the Statement of 
changes in Equity, the Statement of Financial Position and finally the 
Statement of Cash Flows. 
 
Financial Statements 
 
Sample financial statements are presented in the textbook.  It would be 
wise to spend time familiarizing yourself with these formats.  Pick a 
company of interest and google its most current financial statements.  
The more you work with financial statements, the more comfortable you 
will become!

Financial Statements continued 
 
The Income Statement presents the revenues and expenses for a 
period of time.  Presentation varies among entities.  Shareholders are 
keenly interested in the growth of revenue and net income. Please refer 
to Exhibit 2.8. 
 
The Balance Sheet provides users with: 
 
• A snapshot of the assets, liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity 
• Segregation of assets and liabilities as either current or non-
current.  Current means the assets will be converted into cash 
within the next 12 months while the liabilities will be satisfied within 
the next 12 months. 
• Ability to evaluate the liquidity of the entity – is the entity able to 
satisfy its short-term obligations? 
Please refer to Exhibit 2.10 
 
A Statement of Cash Flows is presented in Exhibit 2.12.  While we will 
not discuss this until later in the course, it does provide you with the 
format of the statement. 
 
Communicating financial information is important in accounting.  Page 
2-31 provides an example of how information could be presented.  
Preparing financial statements is an art.  Some management teams are 
much more effective than others at presenting this information.

COMR 457 
Financial Statement Analysis 
 
Once the financial statements are prepared, you need to understand 
how this information will help to analyze the entity.  The textbook 
introduces the first of many financial ratios typically used in practice: 
 
Profit Margin 
= Net income/ Sales revenue 
 
How much of each $ of revenue is profit? 
 
Return on Shareholders’ Equity 
 
= Net income/Average total Shareholders’ Equity (*) 
 
What rate of return are shareholders earning from their investment 
in the entity? 
  
Return on Assets 
 
= Net income/ Average total assets (*) 
 
What rate of return is management generating from its assets? 
 
 
(*) Please note that average referred to in the denominators is the 
average of the beginning and ending amounts of the year 
 
In all three ratios, the higher the return the better. Each provides a 
measure of performance. Typically the current period ratio will be 
compared to either performance in previous periods or other 
competitors.  Users are interested in determining trends.

Journal Entries 
 
It should be evident that the initial examples used in the chapter would 
be cumbersome if an entity had thousands of transactions to record. In 
order to deal with this issue, accountants have developed a system to 
analyze and record transactions. These are called journal entries. 
This involves recording transactions as either debits or credits.  
 
We will address journal entries in Chapter 3.

Cash and Accounts Receivable (Part 2) 
 
Most companies allow customers to buy on credit - i.e., they are granted 
time to pay for their purchases.  The hope is that sales and net income 
will be increased as a result of such policies. 
 
Good internal control should ensure that credit is granted wisely – 
checking credit histories prior to credit being granted, credit limits are 
evaluated for each customer and prompt follow up of any amounts 
unpaid after the stated payment terms. 
 
Despite good internal controls, some customers are either unable or 
unwilling to pay their accounts. How should a company account for 
accounts receivable that prove to be uncollectible? 
 
One approach is to wait until the account is known to be uncollectible 
and then simply write it off at that time. The journal entry would be:  
 
Dr Bad debt expense  
Cr         Accounts (Trade) Receivables  
 
This approach, which is not widely accepted, is known as the direct 
write-off method. There are two drawbacks to this approach. First, it is 
dependent on determining when an account is deemed to be 
uncollectible (i.e., a management decision and therefore subject to 
manipulation) and secondly it often results in the write-off being 
recognized in a different period than when the original sale was recorded 
– a violation of the matching principle.

COMR 457 
The Allowance Method 
 
In order to satisfy the matching principle, most companies use the 
Allowance Method. Under this method, an estimate is made each 
period of the bad debt expense. Estimates can be made using either the 
Percentage of Credit Sales Method or the Aging of Accounts 
(Trade) Receivables Method. The first method focuses on the Income 
Statement while the later method focuses on the Balance Sheet.  
 
Percentage of Credit Sales Method  
 
Under the Percentage of Credit Sales method, the bad debt expense is 
determined by multiplying Credit Sales by an estimate of those sales 
which will prove to be uncollectible - often based on prior credit history 
(usually expressed as a %).  
 
The Journal entry is: 
 
Dr Bad debt expense  
Cr        Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra account that offsets 
Accounts (Trade) Receivables.  
 
When a specific account receivable is actually known to be uncollectible, 
the journal entry required under the allowance method is:  
 
Dr Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
Cr            Accounts (Trade) Receivable  
 
 
 

 
 
© Scott M. Sinclair, FCPA, FCA  2022 
 
3 
COMR 457 
Should an account previously written off become collectible, the entry to 
reinstate the account is:   
 
Dr Accounts (Trade) Receivable  
Cr            Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 
While the balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts may go into a 
debit balance during the year, it can never end the year in a debit 
balance.  
 
Aging of Accounts (Trade) Receivables Method  
 
The aging method determines the ending balance in Allowance for 
Doubtful Accounts based on the $ amount of Accounts (Trade) 
Receivables that are thought to be uncollectible. 
  
The older a receivable, the greater the likelihood that it will prove 
uncollectible. Under this method, you must first prove what the year-end 
balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts should be.  This amount 
is calculated by applying an uncollectible factor to each category (i.e., 
less than 30 days (current), over 30 days, over 60 days, over 90 days) 
of accounts receivable.  The older the receivable the greater the 
likelihood the amount will be uncollectible.  You then compare the 
required ending balance to the balance currently in the account (prior to 
your adjusting journal entry). The difference is the bad debt expense for 
the period.  The factors applied should be based on historical 
experience. 
 
Under this method, the accounts used in the journal entries for setting 
up the bad debt expense (note the number would be different than that 
determined under the percentage of credit sales method), the write-off 
of a receivable and the reinstatement of a receivable previously written 
off are the same as those presented for the percentage of credit sales 
method.

When attempting questions on this topic, don’t mix the two 
methods - be clear what information must be used and what 
information is irrelevant. 
 
There is a great deal of judgment required when establishing these 
estimates. Management should be monitoring write-offs carefully. 
Excessive write-offs may be indicative that credit is being granted to 
unsuitable customers (i.e., poor credit risks). 
 
In practice, management’s bias is to understate the Allowance for 
Doubtful Accounts therefore overstating Net Accounts (Trade) 
Receivables and net income for the period.  
 
Financial presentation of Accounts Receivable is:  
 
Accounts (Trade) Receivables  
Less: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
Net Accounts Receivable  
 
 
Financial Statement Analysis  
 
In order to measure the effectiveness of management’s credit-granting 
and collection policies you will find the Accounts Receivable Turnover 
ratio very useful:  
 
= Net credit Sales/Average net Accounts (Trade) Receivables  
 
If net credit sales is not available, use net revenue from the income 
Statement. 
 
As with all ratios, we are interested in trends within the company and 
with competitors in the industry.

COMR 457 
Financial Statement Analysis continued  
 
Generally, the higher the ratio the more effective the policies have been. 
It means Accounts Receivables are being collected more quickly.  
 
An alternative ratio, the Average collection period, is calculated as 
follows: 
 
= 365/ Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio 
 
In understanding this ratio, the higher number means receivables are 
not being collected on a timely basis and may be indicative of 
uncollectible accounts and/or poor credit collection policies. 
 
Assessing Liquidity 
 
Users are interested in the liquidity of an entity – the ability to convert 
assets into cash in order to satisfy short-term liabilities. 
 
Current Ratio 
 
= Current assets/ Current liabilities 
 
 
Quick Ratio 
 
= (Current assets – Inventory – Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities 
 
This is a refinement of the current ratio that includes only quick assets.  Bank loans 
often include covenants of minimum current and/or quick ratios.  Once again, we 
are interested in the trend of these ratios.  We will return to these ratios in Chapter 
12 when we conclude the course with financial analysis.

Reporting and interpreting the Statement of Cash Flows 
 
To many this is the most important financial statement! 
 
Companies and investors need to pay special attention to, and closely 
analyze, the Statement of Cash Flows. The Statement of Cash Flows 
assists users in assessing the extent to which operations are generating 
sufficient cash flow from the business. Has the company been 
reinvesting adequate cash resources to provide for future expansion of 
the business? Has the company been supporting business growth 
through debt or equity? Is the company generating positive cash flow? 
The answers to these questions will enable analysts and investors to 
assess the extent, timing and risk associated with future cash flows.  
There are three main components of a Statement of Cash Flows - 
operating, investing and financing activities.  
  
For COMR457 you will only be responsible for the indirect method. 
Please work through the examples on pages 5-12 to 5-23 in the 
textbook to acquaint yourself with this method.  The direct method, 
while not examinable, is discussed on pages 5-24 to 5-254 for those 
wishing further information.   
  
Cash flows from Operating Activities   
  
1. The measurement of cash flow from operating activities can be 
determined by either the direct method (reports the gross receipts and 
gross payments) or the indirect method (starts with net income and 
eliminates non-cash transaction that impact net income).   
2. It is important to recognize that cash flow from operations is the 
same regardless of which method is used. The indirect method is 
generally the more widely used.   
 
 

 
 
© Scott M. Sinclair, FCPA, FCA  2022 
 
2 
COMR 457 
Cash flows from Investing Activities  
  
1. Measures cash flow from transactions that relate to the purchase and 
disposal of long-term productive assets and investments in the 
securities of other companies   
2. Outflows reflect cash expended to acquire the assets and inflows 
result from cash received from the disposal of long-term assets   
3. The difference between these cash inflows and outflows is referred to 
as net cash flow from investing activities  
  
Cash flows from Financing Activities   
  
1. Represents the cash inflows and outflows from external sources 
(owners and creditors) to finance the enterprise and its operations – 
issuance of shares and bonds payable for cash.   
2. Outflows reflect cash used to repay creditors or repurchase shares 
from owners.   
3. The difference between these cash inflows and outflows is referred to 
as net cash flow from financing activities   
  
Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash   
  
1. Reconciliation of the net change in cash (equivalents) is presented in 
the following format:  
  
+/- Net cash from operations   
+/- Net cash from investing activities   
+/- Net cash from financing activities   
= Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   
+/- Net cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period   
= Net cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period   
  

 
 
© Scott M. Sinclair, FCPA, FCA  2022 
 
3 
COMR 457 
Cash equivalents are amounts that are almost like cash – i.e., short-term 
deposits cashable within 90 days.   
 
You will find the use of T accounts very helpful in analyzing the changes 
in the non-current Balance Sheet accounts.  While current accounts 
can be determined by simply determining the net change in each 
account, you must analyze the noncurrent accounts completely as 
they may contain both sources and uses of cash.   
  
Relationships to the Balance Sheet and Income Statement   
1. Preparation of the Statement of Cash Flow requires analysis of the 
comparative Balance Sheets, an Income Statement for the period 
and other information. 
2. Accrual based accounting entries need to be examined for their cash 
components.   
3. The focus is on account balance changes on the Balance Sheet. 
4. General rules for the Statement of Cash Flows:   
 Transactions that result in an increase in assets will result in a 
decrease in cash flow   
 Transactions that result in a decrease in assets will result in an 
increase in cash flow   
 Transactions that result in an increase in liabilities will result in 
an increase in cash flow   
 Transactions that result in a decrease in liabilities will result in a 
decrease in cash flow   
 
Many will find this topic of cash flows confusing. Practicing questions is 
the most efficient way of learning this material.  Please attempt and 
review the practice questions posted on canvas.

OVERVIEW - CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES – INDIRECT METHOD  
  
1. Since Net Income is computed using the accrual method, net income 
will include cash and non-cash items.  
2. Adjust net income for non-cash transactions (amortization, 
depreciation, gains/losses on disposals of long-term investments)   
3. Adjust net income for changes in current assets and current liabilities 
(non-cash working capital) that relate to operations. Cash increases 
when a current asset decreases or a current liability increases. Cash 
decreases when a current asset increases or a current liability 
decreases. Refer to Exhibit 5.7 for a summary of the impact of 
changes in current assets and liabilities. 
4. The format for cash flow from operations should appear as follows: 
• Net Income   
+/- non-cash income/expense items (from the income statement) 
+/- changes in non-cash working capital accounts relating to 
operating activities (from the balance sheet) 
= cash flow from (to) operating activities   
  
INTERPRETING CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS   
  
1. This section focuses of cash flow from operations is to provide 
feedback on the entity’s ability to generate cash flow from internal 
sources through operations and management of working capital.   
2. The statement should assist users in assessing the company’s ability 
to meeting ongoing funding requirements, pay cash dividends and 
contribute to long-term funding.  
3. Special attention should be noted for entities that report growing 
earnings and declining cash flow from operations. Determine the 
reasons - Is it seasonality? Is it reflective of red flags related to asset 
management etc.?

CALCULATING CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES   
  
1. This section focuses on analyzing the changes in account balances in 
the short-term investments and long-term asset sections of the 
Balance Sheet. 
2. Transactions that increase the account balances are reflective of cash 
outflows and reductions of the account balances are reflective of cash 
inflows. 
3. Decreases in cash flows are the result of acquisitions of short-term 
investments and long-term assets for cash (acquisitions of shares in 
other companies, additions to long-lived assets, acquisitions of 
intangibles etc.). 
4. Increases in cash flows are generally proceeds received on the 
dispositions of short-term investments and long-term assets. 
5. Depreciation and gains and losses although directly related to 
underlying investing activities are part of cash flow from operations 
due to their inclusion in the determination of net income.  
 
INTERPRETING CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
  
1. Is the company reinvesting in new productive assets? 
2. Will the company be able to undertake and fund future expansion 
requirements?

COMR 457 
CALCULATING CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
  
1. This section focuses on activities that involve the generation of 
funding from creditors and investors and the eventual payments to 
these stakeholders   
2. It includes related current liabilities (notes payable and current 
portion of long-term debt), long-term liabilities and shareholders’ 
equity accounts.   
3. Increases to notes and long-term debt and issues of equity increases 
cash flow. 
4. Principal repayments, repurchases of equity and the payment of cash 
dividends reduce cash flow. 
 
NON-CASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITY   
  
Although transactions not involving cash are not recognized on the 
Statement of Cash Flow (e.g., the issue of shares in exchange for the 
acquisition of an asset) they are noted in supplemental disclosures.  
  
In order to understand the Statement of Cash Flows you have to 
understand the entries involved in all of the financial statements – that 
is why we have left it for the last of the statements.  In my experience, 
most clients struggle to understand this statement.

Cash and Accounts Receivable (Part 1) 
Cash-to-Cash Cycle 
 
You will often hear management discussing ways to shorten an entity’s 
cash-to-cash cycle. This cycle is the time period between when a 
business pays cash to its suppliers for inventory and receives cash from 
its customers. The concept is used to determine the amount of cash 
needed to fund ongoing operations, and is a key factor in estimating 
financing requirements. Clearly the goal is to minimize this cycle. 
 
As one would expect the cash-to-cash cycles are dependent on the type 
of business under review.  A fruit and vegetable store has a very short 
cash-to-cash cycle whereas a winery has a much longer cash-to-cash 
cycle. 
 
Internal controls 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation of timely, reliable and 
complete financial information. The Board of Directors is responsible for 
ensuring that processes are in place for maintaining the integrity of the 
company’s accounting system and the financial statement preparation 
and reporting.  This is an important objective of internal controls.  Other 
objectives include ensuring the efficient use of company assets and 
complying with laws and regulations. 
 
The larger the entity, the more important controls become – an owner 
cannot be overseeing all aspects of a large organization.

Internal controls continued 
 
The main principles of effective internal control are: 
 
• Ensuring adequate physical controls 
• Assignment of Responsibilities 
• Segregating incompatible duties 
• Independent verification of transactions 
• Documentation 
 
While these are relatively straight forward, it is helpful to think about the 
consequences of not implementing internal controls.  For example, 
assume one person in the company has complete responsibility for the 
all aspects of a transaction (i.e., initiation, processing, accounting, 
payment, etc.).  Such a situation provides that person with the 
opportunity to commit fraud.  If a supervisor or manager never reviewed 
or verified the transactions, there is little likelihood of the fraud ever 
being discovered. 
 
While internal controls are necessary, they are not without the following 
limitations: 
 
• they must be cost efficient  
• they are carried out by humans and therefore subject to human 
error 
• they can be overridden by management 
• they can be circumvented by collusion – i.e., two or more 
employees working together 
• they can be ineffective for transactions not contemplated when the 
systems were initially established – i.e., unusual or infrequent 
transactions and changing circumstances

COMR 457 
As we work through the remaining chapters, think about the importance 
of internal controls in each area of discussion.  I will include further 
comments and examples as we work through each topic. 
 
CASH 
 
A company must generate sufficient cash to sustain itself and expend 
that cash to pay employees and suppliers.  Ensuring that sufficient cash 
is on hand at all times requires careful monitoring.  As cash is a valuable 
and liquid asset, management would be wise to ensure it is well 
protected.  Segregation of duties is very important in the handling of, and 
accounting, for cash. Basic principles of internal control as applied to 
cash would include: 
 
• daily depositing of all cash and cheques 
• restricting access to cash 
• approval of all invoices by management 
• payment of all expenditures by cheque 
• requiring two signatures on each cheque 
• the verification of cash balances on an ongoing basis. 
 
Of particular interest is the verification of cash.  An important internal 
control for cash is a periodic bank reconciliation. It is a comparison of 
the cash per the accounting records of the entity to those of the entity’s 
bank. 
 
Before commencing our discussion, it is important to understand that if 
the entity and the bank have each recorded all transactions 
simultaneously without error, then the two balances would always agree. 
Such circumstances seldom arises. 
 
Most differences arise from either timing differences or errors. Timing 
differences arise because there are lags between the time amounts 
are recorded in the accounting records and the date they are

COMR 457 
processed by the bank. For example, a cheque is prepared and 
recorded on December 29, 2022 and mailed to a supplier. The cheque 
may take 7-10 days to make its way to the bank – the bank will not 
process it until 2023 – the next fiscal year. Such differences are 
reasonable and require no adjustments. Timing differences may have to 
be investigated if they remain outstanding for a significant period.  
 
Errors can result from bank and/or entity mistakes such as 
incorrect recording of cheques and deposits, cashing or 
depositing of cheques that do not belong to the entity. The bank 
must amend its records for identified bank errors.  The entity must 
amend its accounting records for entity errors and items not yet 
recorded. 
 
Let’s review the definitions of the important terms to help you better 
understand the process. 
 
Items that affect the balance per the bank 
 
Outstanding deposit – a deposit recorded by the entity but not yet 
processed by the bank. (Timing Difference) 
 
Outstanding cheque – a cheque written and recorded by the entity but 
not yet processed by the bank. (Timing Difference) 
 
Bank error – a misstatement which either increases or decreases the 
records of the bank– e.g., a cheque of another customer of the bank is 
charged to the entity’s bank account or a deposit made to the entity’s 
bank account which belongs to another customer of the bank. (Error) 
 
Please note that none of the above items will ever result in a journal 
entry on the company’s books. The bank must amend its records.

COMR 457 
 
Items that affect the Cash per the Entity’s Accounting Records 
 
Items recorded on the bank statement that have not been recorded 
on the entity’s records. Examples include deposits collected by the 
bank or electronic payments paid by the bank or bank interest or account 
charges. 
 
NSF cheques – customer cheques received by the entity and deposited 
to the bank are subsequently determined to be worthless as the 
customer has insufficient funds to cover the cheque. 
 
Entity errors – items which have been incorrectly handled by the 
entity – e.g., cheques written but not recorded, cheques written for 
amounts which differ from the entries made in the entity’s records.  
 
The entity will have to prepare journal entries to ensure the 
transactions have been properly reflected in its accounting 
records.  
 
Bank Reconciliation Template 
 
A bank reconciliation is a time-consuming and picky exercise.  Entity 
accounting records must be matched to each entry on the monthly bank 
statement. The reconciliation should be done frequently and ideally 
prepared by an individual not responsible for preparing or recording 
banking activates. A commonly used format for completing and 
organizing the reconciliation is presented on the next page:

Journal entries arising from a bank reconciliation 
 
As previously noted, the only journal entries to be recorded by the entity 
arise from items found in reconciling the Accounting Records side of the 
reconciliation.  For example: 
 
• A deposit listed on the bank statement but not in the entity’s 
accounting records must be recorded: 
 
Dr Cash  
 
 
125 
Cr 
Rental revenue 
 
 
125 
 
This records revenue received by the bank directly from one of the 
company’s tenants. 
 
• Identification of an NSF cheque 
 
Dr Accounts Receivable 250 
Cr      Cash 
 
 
 
 
250 
 
In this example, the customer gave the company a worthless cheque. 
As a result, the company must reinstate the receivable and reduce the 
cash balance on its accounting records. 
 
It is a good idea to review your bank statements on a monthly basis 
to identify any errors or unusual transactions.

Chapters Nine and Ten 
 
Reporting and Interpreting Liabilities 
 
Very few businesses pay cash for all of their expenditures and 
expenses. Rather they owe monies to suppliers who have 
provided inventory on account and/or owe amounts to other 
creditors who have provided services to the company. These 
amounts will need to be paid relatively quickly. In accounting 
terms these are known as current liabilities which are defined 
to be short-term obligations that will be repaid within the current 
operating cycle of the business or within one year of the balance 
sheet date, whichever is longer. In our case it will be within one 
year of the balance sheet date. 
 
Actual Liabilities 
 
We have prepared Classified Balance Sheets that separate 
current and long-term liabilities. The following is a list of 
commonly encountered current liabilities: 
• 
Accounts payable - amounts owed to suppliers of 
inventory 
• 
Accrued liabilities - expenses which that have been 
incurred but not yet paid 
• 
Income tax payable - amount owed to Canada 
Revenue Agency for taxes on income earned in the year 
• 
Payroll liabilities - amount owed to employees & 
governments Interest payable - interest owed but not yet 
paid 

 
 
© Scott M. Sinclair, FCPA, FCA  2022 
 
2 
COMR 457 
• 
Notes payable - amounts owed to lenders who required 
the entity to sign promissory notes. A promissory note 
requires the borrower to promise to repay a sum of 
money on a particular day with a stated rate of interest 
• 
Current portion of long-term debt – the amount of long-
term debt owed within one year of the balance sheet 
• 
Unearned revenue - the amount of unearned revenue 
that the entity believes will be earned within the next 
twelve months of the balance sheet date 
 
Provisions 
 
Another component of liabilities is called provisions that refers to 
a situation where the amount or timing of a liability is 
uncertain. A provision must be recognized when: 
• 
an entity has a present obligation as a result of a past 
event 
• 
it is probable that cash or other assets will be required 
to settle the obligation, and 
• 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. 
 
Warranty liabilities are included in  provisions as the amount and 
timing of any potential claims is uncertain. The provision arises 
from the sale of a product. Any entity that offers a warranty on its 
product should estimate the provision at each balance sheet date. 
 
Warranties that provide assurance that the product will function as 
promised are known as assurance-type warranties.    Warranties 
that provide coverage beyond the assurance type warranties are 
referred to as service-type warranties.

COMR 457 
When an entity estimates a liability in respect of ongoing legal and 
tax disputes this would normally be found under “provisions” in the 
Balance Sheet. 
 
Contingent liabilities 
 
A contingent liability is defined to be a possible obligation that 
arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. 
 
Examples 
of 
contingent 
liabilities 
include 
lawsuits, 
tax 
reassessments, environmental problems and loan guarantees. 
Because the outcome is unknown, it is unclear whether a liability 
will ever occur. Regardless of the outcome, the reader of the 
financial statement would be interested in the circumstances 
surrounding these potential liabilities. 
 
While the accounting treatment for contingencies depends on 
whether an entity uses ASPE or IFRS, a simple approach is to 
consider the following guidelines: 
 Accrue or recognize a liability on the Balance Sheet 
if it is probable that a liability will occur and the 
amount can be reasonably measured, 
 
 Disclose a note in the notes to the financial 
statements if the liability cannot be measured or it is 
uncertain whether a liability will occur, or 
 
• Ignore the item (i.e., neither accrue a liability nor 
disclose the event) from the financial statements if it is 
remote that any liability will occur.

Chapter 10 Long-term Liabilities 
 
Company Expansion 
 
When a company decides to expand, it must decide how to finance 
an expansion. There are usually two major alternatives to 
consider – issuance of long-term debt and/or the issuance of 
share capital. The remainder of this chapter will discuss bonds 
payable (i.e., long-term debt) while Chapter 11 discusses the 
issuance of equity - either common or preferred shares. 
 
Long-term Loans or Mortgages 
 
For smaller entities, long-term assets should be financed with long-
term loans or mortgages.  It would be risky to finance the purchase 
of a building with a short-term or demand loan.  Long-term loans 
require monthly blended payments of both principal and interest 
payments.  These loans are often amortized over 20-25 years. 
 
Bonds Payable 
 
Large public companies often finance major projects by issuing 
bonds. 
 
As opposed to bringing on new shareholders, a company may 
decide to borrow the necessary funds. Unlike securing a bank 
demand loan that is used to finance inventory and/or accounts 
receivable, management must secure long-term financing from 
financial markets.

COMR 457 
When a borrower and a lender enter into a contract for a large 
amount of money, one would expect that the contract between 
the two to be long and detailed. In order to understand bonds, 
it is important to familiarize yourself with the terms often found in 
the contract that are discussed on pages 10-7 to 10-8.  
Important bond definitions: 
I would like to highlight the following terms: 
• Bond agreement (indenture) – the formal agreement 
between the borrower and lender outlining the specifics of the 
agreement 
• Bond Covenants - the specific restrictions that are placed 
on the borrower - (e.g., dividend restrictions, salary bonus 
restrictions, capital asset restrictions, minimum current ratios 
etc.) 
• Face (par) value - the stated (principal) value of the bond 
• Maturity date - the date the borrower must repay the lender 
the face value of the bond 
• Bond (Stated or Coupon) interest rate - the interest rate 
specified in the bond indenture 
• Market (discount or yield) rate – the interest rate currently 
required by investors on similar bonds 
 
Exhibit 10.2 on page 10-8 provides a very good comparison 
between Bonds and Loans and mortgage.

COMR 457 
How are Bonds priced? 
 
In a perfect world, a company will issue a bond with the stated 
interest rate equaling the market interest rate. When this happens, 
the bond will sell at its face or par value. 
 
Remember the following whenever completing bond questions: 
 
• 
A bond will sell for an amount equal to the present value 
of the remaining actual interest payments plus the present 
value of its face or maturity value. The interest payments 
are always equal to the par value of the bond times 
the stated interest rate. The present value is always 
calculated using the market interest rate at the date 
the bond was issued.  
 
When preparing present value calculations, you will need a 
financial calculator or, for our purposes, two present value tables 
which will be distributed as a handout in class or provided on 
examinations.  Often people get these tables mixed up – the 
factor used to discount the principal value will always be less 
than 1 while the factor used to calculate the present value of the 
interest payments will always be greater than 1. 
 
The key to understanding the selling or issue price of a bond 
is to appreciate the relationship between the market and the 
stated interest rates. There are three situations that may arise: 
 
Market interest rate = Stated interest rate 
In this situation, as noted above, the bond will be issued or will 
sell for its par value.

COMR 457 
How are Bonds priced? continued 
 
Market interest rate is greater than the Stated interest rate 
 
In this situation, the borrower is not prepared to pay the market 
rate of interest. As a result, the lender will only lend funds that 
will allow them to earn the market rate of interest. Thus, the lender 
will lend an amount less than the par value of the bond.  
In this situation, the bond is said to be sold at a discount. 
 
Market interest rate is less than the Stated interest rate 
 
In this situation, the borrower is offering to pay an interest rate 
that is above the market rate. As a result, the lender will be 
prepared to lend more funds than the face value of the bonds as 
this will still allow them to earn their desired market rate of interest.  
In this situation, the bond is said to be sold at a premium. 
 
As we work through this chapter, remember we are talking 
about a situation where a company issues bonds that trade on 
the stock market. They are not like Canada Savings Bonds that 
are more like a guaranteed investment certificate. 
 
I have prepared handouts of a bond issued at a premium and one 
at a discount. Please refer to my example posted on Canvas e 
which we will cover in class.

Journal entries for Bonds 
Bond sold at par 
The entry to record bonds sold at par is:  
Dr Cash 
Cr       Bonds Payable (Long-term liability) 
 
The bonds will sell at face value because the two interest rates 
are the same. 
 
Each period the borrower must pay interest payments to the 
lender. The interest expense will always equal the face value 
of the bonds times the stated interest rate for the period. It is 
important to determine whether the interest is being paid 
annually or semi-annually. Unless advised, the interest rates 
provided in the questions will always be annual rates. If you 
are given a stated annual rate of 8% and the interest is paid 
annually, the interest payment at the end of each year will be the 
par value of the bond times 8%. However, if the interest is paid 
semi-annually, the interest expense per period will equal the par 
value of the bond times 4% (8/2). 
The journal entry to record the interest will be: 
Dr Interest expense 
Cr      Interest payable/Cash 
 
When a bond is issued at its par value, the interest expense 
will always equal the interest payment.

COMR 457 
On the maturity date, the borrower will repay the par value of the 
bond: 
Dr Bond payable 
Cr 
Cash 
The amount repaid will always equal the maturity or par value. 
 
Bond sold at a discount 
 
Remember that the bond will have b e e n  s o l d  a t  a  
d i s c o u n t  because the stated rate of interest is less than the 
market rate of interest. The only way an investor will buy the 
bond is if they pay an amount less than the par value. The most 
they should pay is the present value of the interest payments 
and par value discounted at the market rate of interest. 
The entry to record the sale of a bond at a discount is: 
Dr Cash 
Dr Discount on Bonds payable 
Cr 
Bonds payable 
 
Notice that the bonds payable is still recorded at the maturity or 
par value. The difference between the selling price (i.e., the 
amount of cash you received) and the par value is called “Discount 
on Bonds payable”. This is a contra account that will offset the 
Bonds payable account on the Balance Sheet. The discount will 
be amortized over the life of the bonds. It really represents 
additional interest expense that must be paid when the bond is 
repaid. The discount will be reduced each period and will equal 
zero at the maturity date. Remember that even though the 
borrower received less cash than the par value of the bond, they 
still are obligated to repay the par value of the bond at the 
maturity date.

COMR 457 
Bond sold at a discount continued 
The discount can be amortized one of two ways: 
• On a straight-line basis over the life of the bond  
• Using the effective-interest method 
 
Most companies use the effective-interest method. 
 
Before we review the entries, remember the interest payments made 
by the borrower will always be constant and equal to the par value 
of the bond times the stated interest rate for the period. However, 
the interest expense recorded by the company will always be higher 
than the interest payments because of the amortization of the 
discount. 
 
The interest expense for a period will always equal the carrying value 
of the bond at the beginning of the period times the market rate 
of interest. If a bond is sold at a discount, it means the market rate 
of interest is higher than the stated interest rate. As the discount 
is amortized, the carrying value of the bond will increase each period. 
As a result, the interest expense will rise slightly each period. 
The journal entry to record interest expense each period will be:  
Dr Interest expense (Carrying value * Market interest rate) 
Cr        Discount on Bonds payable 
Cr        Interest payable/ Cash (Par value*Stated interest rate) 
 
The carrying value is equal to the par value of the bond minus 
any balance in the Discount on Bonds payable account.

COMR 457 
The total amount of interest expense recorded over its life on a 
bond issued at a discount is equal to the sum of the interest 
payments made over the bond’s life plus the amount of the 
discount. 
Bond sold at a premium 
 
This situation is the exact opposite of the example just discussed. In 
this case the stated interest rate is greater than the market rate of 
interest. Consequently, a bond should sell at a premium - i.e., the 
borrower will receive more cash than the par value of the bond. As 
with the discount, the premium must be amortized and therefore 
interest expense will be less than the actual interest payment.  
 
The entry to record a bond at a premium is: 
 
Dr Cash 
Cr 
Premium on Bonds payable 
Cr 
Bonds payable 
 
Remember the interest payments are constant and equal to the 
par value of the bond times the stated interest rate. To 
calculate the interest expense, multiply the carrying value of the 
bond at the beginning of the period times the market interest 
rate. The resulting entry is: 
 
Dr Interest expense (Carrying value * Market interest rate) 
Dr Premium on Bonds payable 
Cr         Interest payable/Cash (Par value*Stated interest rate) 
 
Notice that the carrying value of the bond is decreasing each period that 
means the interest expense will be decreasing slightly each period. The 
total amount of interest expense recorded over its life on a bond issued

at a premium is equal to the sum of the interest payments made over 
the bond’s life minus the amount of the premium. 
 
Financial Statement Analysis 
 
Debt to Equity ratio 
 
This ratio is calculated as follows: 
 
=Net debt (*) / Shareholders’ Equity 
 
*Net debt = interest-bearing debt – Cash 
 
This ratio measures the amount of debt relative to shareholders’ equity. 
 
Debt as a % of Total Capitalization 
 
= Net debt / (Shareholders’ Equity + Interest-bearing debt – Cash) 
 
This ratio measures what percentage debt represents of the company’s 
total financing. 
 
Interest Coverage 
 
This ratio is calculated as follows: 
 
= EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization) / Interest Expense 
 
This ratio calculates the number of times a company’s earnings could 
pay its interest expense. 
 
Companies need to watch their debt levels and their ability to make 
interest payments.

Overview of Corporate Financial Accounting 
 
Objective of Financial Statements  
 
• Communicate 
financial 
information 
to 
3rd 
parties 
(Users/Stakeholders) for decision-making  
 
A better quality of financial statements should allow users to make better 
decisions.  
 
Users and their needs 
 
Owners 
Can we afford to buy a new piece 
of machinery? Should we pay 
dividends? 
Has 
management 
done a good job? 
Creditors 
Will this entity be able to pay our 
bills on a timely basis?  Is there too 
much risk in dealing with this 
entity? 
Government Agencies 
Is 
this 
entity 
paying 
the 
appropriate amount of income tax 
or 
workers 
compensation 
premiums? 
Potential Investors 
Is an investment in this entity 
advisable? 
 
Users can be further classified as either internal or external.  The biggest 
difference between the two is that internal users (i.e. those that work for 
the entity) are easily able to obtain further information. Additional 
discussion may be found in Exhibit 1.2.

Users and their needs continued 
 
As the objectives of users vary widely; it is difficult to satisfy the needs 
of all users in a single set of financial statements. A set of Financial 
Statements should meet the common needs of most users. 
 
Structure of Entities 
 
Corporations 
The most common form of entity and the one discussed in this course is 
the corporation.  A corporation is a separate legal entity- distinct from its 
owners who are known as shareholders. 
 
Corporations can be formed under either Provincial or Federal laws.  
Although you can form your own corporation (i.e. online) it is probably 
wise to have a commercial lawyer incorporate it for you. Your legal 
advisor will be able to evaluate your situation and structure the 
transaction in the most effective manner. In the long run, it is much 
cheaper to set a corporation up properly in the first place as opposed to 
having to amend it at a later time. 
 
Proprietorships 
 
Suppose you want to set up your own business.  It is possible to simply 
start your business by picking a name (assuming it is not a name used 
by another entity) and start your business. You may even run the 
business out of your home!  There is one owner or proprietor.  The 
business is the owner.  The owner will have to include the income 
earned from the business in their yearly personal tax return.  Unlike a 
corporation, the owner is not separate from the business.  If the business 
fails, the owner is personally liable for any unpaid liabilities of the 
business.

COMR 457 
Structure of entities continued 
 
Partnerships 
A partnership is an entity owned by two of more partners.  Partners are 
able to generate synergies by working together.  Like proprietorships, 
the partners are personally liable for the unpaid liabilities of the 
partnership and must include their portion of the partnership income in 
their personal income tax returns.  Partners should ensure they have a 
signed written partnership agreement in place to deal with disputes 
and/or death of any partners.  As might be expected, one of the biggest 
problems with partnerships is that the partners cannot work together.  
Pick your partners wisely!  
 
Regardless of the structure of your business, the basic accounting 
use for each entity is the same.  However, the complexity of issues, 
the volume of transactions and the format of financial statements 
will differ. Exhibit 1.4 provides a good comparison of the three

Accounting System  
 
• A system that collects and processes financial information about 
an organization and reports that information to decision-makers.  
 
This course focuses on external decision-making. Managerial 
accounting is that branch of accounting deal with internal decision-
making.  
 
Economic Environment  
 
An effective accountant must be familiars with the  business 
environment in which the entity operates. It is important to understand 
the entity, the competitors, the customers and the products/services sold 
or rendered.

Financial Statements  
 
Prior to 2011, Canada had essentially one set of accounting policies for 
the preparation of financial statements know as Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP).   
 
Today there are two predominant frameworks for preparing financial 
statements for for-profit entities in Canada: 
 
• International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) – a set of 
standards created by an international organization that must be 
followed by entities known as publically accountable profit-oriented 
enterprise. 
 
• Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE) – a set of 
standards created by the Canadian Accounting Standards Board 
to be used by private companies. 
 
Without going into detail, the basic difference is the volume and 
complexity of disclosure required under each framework.  Public 
companies, those whose shares trade on a stock exchange and affect 
a large number of users, are required to follow IFRS.  
 
While Private companies may choose to follow IFRS, they are more 
likely to follow ASPE whose standards are much less onerous.  Most 
private companies have fewer users and those users are more likely 
involved in day-to-day activities.

Financial Statements continued 
 
While there are differences in titles, there are basically four financial 
statements: 
 
IFRS 
 
• Balance Sheet or Statement of Financial Position – presented at a 
point in time. 
• Statement of Comprehensive Income – presented for a period of 
time. 
• Statement of Changes in Equity – presented for a period of time. 
• Statement of Cash Flows – presented for a period of time. 
 
ASPE 
 
• Balance Sheet or Statement of Financial Position – presented at a 
point in time. 
• Statement of Income – presented for a period of time. 
• Statement of Changes in Retained Earnings – presented for a 
period of time. 
• Statement of Cash Flows – presented for a period of time. 
 
While some mention of the differences will be made in the course, 
a detailed discussion of the differences is covered in intermediate 
and advanced accounting courses.

Accounting Equation  
 
Regardless of the entity or framework, a fundamental rule in 
accounting is: 
 
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity  
 
It is important to keep this in mind when analyzing accounting 
transactions. When you do something to one side of the equation 
something has to change on the other side.  Otherwise the Balance 
Sheet won’t balance! 
 
Let’s take a close look at the financial statements prepared under 
ASPE 
 
Balance Sheet  
 
Listing of assets, liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity at a point in time.  
 
Assets must meet the following three criteria: 
• Economic resources controlled by the entity. 
• The event that gave the company control of the economic asset 
has already happened. 
• Future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity from 
the use or sale of the asset. 
 
Assets are usually classified by category and presented from most liquid 
(i.e. convertible to cash) to least liquid.  
 
The cost principle records assets at their cost - the amount paid to 
acquire the asset. Although assets are not recorded at market value, 
there is a trend to value certain assets at market value - e.g. marketable 
investments.

ASPE continued 
 
Liabilities must meet the following criteria:  
 
• A present obligation of the entity 
• The company expects to settle it through an outflow of economic 
resources. 
• The obligation results from an event that has already happened. 
 
Shareholders’ Equity consists of the following two components: 
  
Contributed Capital – represents permanent investments by 
shareholders – disclosure of the number of shares outstanding and the 
amount received for those shares is required. 
 
Retained Earnings - the amount of earnings retained by the entity since 
inception. (i.e. the amount which has been earned but not yet distributed 
to the shareholders via dividends). 
 
 
Income Statement 
 
This statement reports the revenues earned less the expenses incurred 
to generate the reported revenue. The difference is the Profit or Loss for 
the period (Net profit or loss).  It measures the entity’s operating 
performance for a period of time.

Statement of Changes in Retained Earnings 
 
This statement reconciles the opening balance of retained Earnings to 
the ending balance. 
 
The reconciliation is prepared as follows: 
 
Opening Retained Earnings- Must agree to amount shown as 
Retained Earnings on the Balance Sheet at the start of the period.  
+ Net Income for the period - Must agree to the income statement for the 
period.  
- Dividends declared in the period – Amount declared by the Board of   
Directors in the period  
= Ending Retained Earnings – Must agree to amount shown as Retained 
Earnings on the Balance Sheet at the end of the period.  
 
Statement of Cash Flows 
 
This statement presents the flows of cash related to the following three 
categories of business transactions:  
 
• Operating activities – cash from normal operating activities.  
• Investing activities – where or how cash was invested by 
management. 
• Financing activities – how management financed the entity.  
 
This statement is often difficult for students and investors to understand. 
Remember an entity must generate sufficient cash to remain in 
business. We will delve into this statement in Chapter 5 at the end the 
course.

Notes to the Financial Statements  
 
Necessary to provide detailed information on items included in the above 
noted Financial Statements.  
 
Note presentation is usually very extensive and addresses such items 
as:  
 
• Accounting policies adopted by the entity. 
• Additional detail concerning balances in the financial statements. 
• Disclosure of circumstances (e.g. lawsuits) which would be 
important to users. 
 
Ethics in Accounting 
 
All professional accountants in Canada are bound by a code of ethics  
Some of the more important rules include:  
 
Confidentiality – respecting the information of their clients 
Competence - ensuring they are knowledgeable on the 
engagements they are completing  
Adhering to the CICA Handbook and its recommendations  
Not associating with information they know or should know is false 
and misleading  
Upholding the reputation of the profession
