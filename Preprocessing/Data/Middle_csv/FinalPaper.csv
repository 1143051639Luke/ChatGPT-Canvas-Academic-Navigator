Seismically Active Planet – Mars
"Before the exploitation on Mars, scientists assumed that the degree of seismic activity of Mars is between Moon and Earth (Anderson et al., 1972). In August 1975, Viking lander was launched to Mars to do the seismic experiments but due to the seismometer of Viking lander was affected by wind, it produced lots of noise which disturbed the observations and collected data so that the data it provided might not be very helpful to analyse the structure of Mars and assume the origin of the seismic activities on Mars (Roberts et al., 2012). In November 2018, the InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) landed in Elysium Planitia on Mars and its seismometer, SEIS, started to detect the seismic activity on Mars in 2019 and further identify the interior structure of Mars to explain these seismic activities (Cottaar & Koelemeijer, 2021). In recent past, many scientists also did simulations on Martian conditions, research on HiRISE (""High-Resolution Imaging Experiment"") images from NASA and analysis about the seismic data collected by InSight, the origin of seismic events was gradually determined. It might be concluded that Mars is a seismically active planet and the seismic events on it probably originate from the Martian crust. "

"The observations of populations of mobilized boulders on Mars was an early proof which arose that Mars had lots of seismic activities. According to Roberts et al., NASA's HiRISE (""High-Resolution Imaging Experiment"") images with pixel showed the surface of Mars clearly and were in enough amount for the research areas. After measuring the 10 largest boulders and 10 widest boulder trails at 23 sites selected in Cerberus Fossae by working on these images, this study assumed the dimensions of boulders and concluded the boulder size distributions and the relationship among the mobilized boulders, their trails and nearly cliffs. The width of boulder trails was 11.37m and it decreased to 1.16m as far from the epicenter while the number of trails decreased from 125 to 4.7. The decline tendency not only observed for boulder’s trails but also found for boulder’s sizes. The boulder diameter was also declined from 17.7m to about 1m. At the peak of the data, the study assumed the location to be the epicenter of seismic events. This kind of pattern of the mobilized boulders and their trails was similar to the characteristics of distribution of boulders after the earthquakes (2012). This phenomenon was also found on other areas on Mars, such as Grjota Valles. Brown & Roberts (2019) studied on the mobilized boulders on Grjota Valles, which not only proved the surface faults are locations of marsquakes of large magnitude but also found the boulders’ mobilization was caused in the recent past. These studies provided good evidence to prove the seismic activity of Mars at a stage when there is not much data to support the claim. In the recent years, more and more studies and research tried to use numerical statistics to explain the origin and characteristics of seismic moments on Mars."

"According to Plesa et al., it conducted the simulation with the 3-D numerical thermal evolution models and found that seismic events originate from the Martian crust and probably the deeper crust. This study used 3-D numerical thermal evolution models to analyze the seismogenic depth separately in three end-member crustal thickness models, NC (Neumann crust) model, DC (density dichotomy crust) and HC (high density crust) model, under the two extreme isotherms, 573K and 1073K. It found that under the 573K isotherm, the seismogenic depth for the NC and DC model was between 30 and 100km while under the 1073K isotherm, the seismogenic depth for these two models was between 50 and 250km. The wider range of HC model, which is between 30 and 170km under 573K and between 60 and 450km under 1073K, was result of the thicker crust and variable thickness. Moreover, the deeper depth under 1073K of HC model might also indicate that seismic events are originated from not only the normal crust but also the deeper crust part closing to the core (2018). In a word, the calculated seismogenic depth of crust directly showed the origin part of the seismic events on Mars. However, this study is just a simulation, the results still require realistic data collection to verify its veracity and accuracy. With the development of technology, scientists could find the realistic data from the Mars lander to support the predictions and claims in previous studies."

"In 2018, the InSight mission was launched, and its collected data identified that the majority of marsquakes are generated from Martian crust. The seismometer loaded on InSight lander, SEIS, detected 174 seismic events, which were sorted into two types: low-frequency events with less than 1 Hz energy and high-frequency events with larger than 1 Hz energy (Giardini et al., 2020). Analyzing the distribution, spectra and propagation waves of these two seismic events, Giardini et al. (2020) found that the low-frequency events of magnitude 3-4 were located below the crust while the high-frequency events of smaller magnitude were generated from the crust. Moreover, the data from SEIS, which recorded the bouncing waves from the core caused by deep seismic events, confirmed that the Martian core is composed of sulfur-enriched alloy in a liquid state (Cottaar & Koelemeijer, 2021). The thin mantle of Mars comparing to Earth would lead to a more rapid cooling of Martian core and then triggered the dynamic activity in the crust, such as seismic events and magnitude field (Cottaar & Koelemeijer, 2021). Especially for the region of thin crust, the seismic magnitude is large (Plesa et al., 2018). The structure of Mars displayed by the data from InSight mission helped scientists explain that the origin of marsquakes probably is Martian crust."

"The research which focused on the mobilized boulders and trails still remained possibility that those mobilized boulders were caused by a combination of marsthquakes and other environmental events. For example, boulders could be from melting of ice triggered by the climate or temperature change (Roberts et al., 2012). Because of the climate changes and volcanic activities, the sudden change of temperature may cause the melting of ice and further cause the boulders inside the mountain-like ice scroll down (Roberts et al., 2012). These trajectories are similar to the ones caused by seismic events, which confused scientists to identify the real causes by only using some images. Considering these possible influences, several studies used boulder populations and trails caused by earthquakes and melting ice on Earth to identify whether the boulders on Mars were caused by seismic events or by melting ice. It found that the mobilized boulders’ population and trails caused by melting ice should be spatially uniform (Brown & Roberts, 2019). According to Roberts et al., it measured the boulder size and trails in 100*100 quadrats where the boulder size reduced from the peak to the minimum over tens of kilometers. However, if the boulders were triggered by melting of ice, the boulders would locate over tens to hundreds of kilometers, which is a random distance. Furthermore, the populations of boulders found on the images were not correspond to the characteristics of those released by melting ice, such as facing position relative to the sun, the random distribution of different sizes of boulders and the space between each boulder (2012). In a word, it can be concluded that the mobilization of boulders on Mars related to the ground shaking caused by marsquakes."

"Roberts et al. (2012) used the HiRISE images of Mars to analyze the mobilization of boulders and their trails and confirmed that Mars is a seismically active planet. The simulation of the seismogenic depth of Martian crust done by Plesa et al. (2018) further proved that seismic events on Mars are generated from Martian crust. The InSight mission collected seismic data which allowed scientists to learn more about the planetary structure of Mars and use this information to explain the origin of marsquakes. The predictions, numerical data and realistic data analysis gradually helped people know more about marsquakes and explain the origin of marsquakes. Nowadays, the InSight mission was extended to the end of 2022, which means that lots of helpful data and observations will be sent back to Earth to help us know more details about Mars and prepare for the next detection mission (Cottaar & Koelemeijer, 2021)."
